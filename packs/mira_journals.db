{"_id":"QUs9QcH1LZ9BoYlT","name":"03 - Mira's History","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>MIRA’S HISTORY</h1>\n<p>Mira is known as the cradle of Firstcome colonization, and for many it is also considered its culmination. It is here where a loose federation of city states have co-existed in peaceful competition for centuries. While Algol is commonly recognized as the first colony in the Third Horizon, Mirans claim that the title is rightfully theirs, and will adamantly defend it, regardless of what 'those backwater slave traders from the Demon Star' have to say about it.</p>\n<p>Mira emerged unscathed from the worst ravages of the Portal Wars, despite the cataclysmic events in the neighbouring system of Odacon. However, the Long Night that followed was not entirely without its challenges, and it was in this infamous turmoil of famine and despair that the Church of the Icons was born. Slowly, the teachings of the Church began to spread throughout the Miran system and further out into the Horizon. Few systems put up much resistance to the word of the Icons, with the notable exception of the systems of the Quadrant of the Pillar.</p>\n<p>Another powerful actor that emerged from the Portal Wars was the noble house of Chelebs-Menau, who helped re-establish order and civilization to the system thanks to their highly profitable industries and exquisite shipyard.</p>\n<p>Today, the power of the system is split between the Church of the Icons, the noble houses of the city-states, and the Chelebs-Menau family. The Church controls the Icon City from high up in the floating Dome of the Icons, and make their presence known all throughout the system through their priests, bureaucrats, and warrior nuns of the Weeping Matriarchy.</p>\n<p>The major city states of Mira, such as Bandar Asul, Tifret, and Cimoran are usually ruled by a court of noble houses. They all maintain a proper relationship with the Church, but rumour has it some have secretly entered negotiations with the newly arrived Zenithians to strengthen their position.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"RBPOoncUvdjwrKZv","name":"04 - Powerful Groups","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>POWERFUL GROUPS</h1>\n<h2>CHELEBS-MENAU</h2>\n<p>The influence of the Chelebs-Menau family shines over the system like a fourth sun. Their seat of power is located in the Icon City on Mira, in a magnificent floating fortress overlooking the Chelebs dockyards at the edge of the Intrapelagic Sea. The Chelebs family corporation is famous across the Third Horizon for the stunning beauty of their ships, not to mention their far superior grav projectors.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Chelebs-Menau has forged strong ties to the Zenithian Hegemony on Kua. The Hegemony is in need of additional shipyards for their fleet, and there is much fear and adulation that some day a well placed marriage between the two factions will bring about a powerful dynasty, so large it stretches across the entirety of The Third Horizon.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE CHELEBS JANISSARIES</h3>\n<p>The Chelebs Janissaries are the private security force of Chelebs-Menau, and they provide security for every holding or factory belonging to the family. With their obsidian duralite spears, antique carbines, and purple uniforms, they form a dignified and orderly sight.</p>\n<h2>OKRA-DARMA</h2>\n<p>Okra Darma is the Miran answer to the Syndicate - a criminal organization that exploits the pilgrims who travel throughout the system. Their headquarters is said to be located in the hidden ravines of distant Menau, but their ominous presence can be felt from the heights of Temple City, to the darkened alleys of the slums.The organization utilizes dholes disguised as fishing boats as they cross the city skyline and traverse the pilgrim trails of the Golden Plain.</p>\n<h2>THE WEEPING MATRIARCHY</h2>\n<p>The Weeping Matriarchy is a religious sect dedicated to the Lady of Tears. Led by a triumvirate of sister superiors, they are responsible for the security of the Church and its assets on Mira and Antmira. Older women are known to serve as guards within the Matriarchy, and are treated with great respect by the people of Mira. For dangerous missions and operations outside of the city-states, the Matriarchy uses their well-drilled warrior nuns.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE GREAT JOURNEY</h3>\n<p>Within the Weeping Matriarchy it is customary for young novices to partake in the Hjalikan, or the Great Journey, before being wed to the Lady of Tears. Scores of young women are handed the curved, ceremonial krug-dagger, and sent out into the Horizon, instructed not to return until they are ready to dedicate their lives to the Church. Several of the Horizon's most famous free companies originate from novices who have not yet found the peace to return to Mira.</p>\n<h2>THE TEMPLE GUARD</h2>\n<p>The Temple Guard was officially formed to protect the pilgrim trails and distant monasteries of Mira. There are not nearly enough members to uphold that decree, and many have started to suspect that their real purpose is to act as the Church’s secret police, and to perform the dirty work that the Herats don’t want to deal with. The Temple Guards can be recognized by their shaved heads and the fact that they always bear a tiny sword about their person. This sword, the symbol of the Judge, may take the form of a brooch or tattoo.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"SekNmrfgZQDFKLe1","name":"07 - Travel on Mira","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>TRAVEL ON MIRA</h1>\n<p>Mira, like Menau, is a patchwork of pilgrim trails, paths, and canals. These routes support all kinds of vehicles, easing a traveler’s burden and allowing them to take their pilgrimages at a leisurely pace. For pilgrims and Mirans there is no reason to hurry as they consider the journey a worthwhile goal in itself. Should the journey require more speed, there are always nimble dholes nearby. For the frail, there are dromedones and horses on Mira, and the woolly Cria with its wide grip hooves on Menau.</p>\n<p>Most major cities feature a space port with all the normal conveniences and comforts found in the Horizon. In smaller villages and monastery towns, visitors have to make due at the local serai. These camps on the outskirts of towns can vary wildly, but most feature housing and services for travelers, their mounts, and/or vehicles. Train tracks connect larger city hubs, but the trains themselves tend to be slow and overencumbered compared to the lightning-fast trains of the Conglomerate on Kua.</p>\n<p>Suspended in geostationary orbit above the Icon City is the wheel-shaped station Gherbis, fittingly called ‘the Sky Wheel’ by Mirans. Gherbis is the central hub for all traffic entering or exiting the system, providing routes to the portals and to Mira's sister system Menau. Traveling to Menau requires a long journey through the darkness, constituting over a thousand standard astronomical units. Only the most stubborn colonizers or penitent pilgrims dare to undertake this grueling venture.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE MIRAN DHOL</h3>\n<p>The Miran dhol takes its name from the countless wild dogs roaming the slums of the Icon City. Like these dogs, the dhol is slender, agile, and common as muck. It is a small grav-gondola that serves as a means of transport for both the poor and the rich in the many city-states of Mira. The dholes are kept afloat by the lightweight and sturdy grav projectors produced by the Chelebs corporation. Most dholes are shaped like a small boat, and their hulls are usually decorated with stylized patterns said to give its rider luck during their voyages.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

The Icon City now stands proud as the hub of the entire system, situated by the pearl white beaches of a blue ocean, a place reminiscent of the long distant Al-Ardha, the birthplace of humanity.</p>\n<p>The three original settlements remain to this day as the main districts of the city: The Temple City, the Brick City and the Harbour, now dubbed Chelebs City by the residents. Between the major districts lies the Great Disorder, a chaotic mess of habitation blocks, factories, tailors, gardens and parks, all built in peculiar angles and separated by labyrinthine alleyways.</p>\n<p>Rumour has it that many of the buildings are built atop of the hulls of the first colonization ships, and some archaeologists believe that the hills actually hide strange artifacts from the time of the Portal Builders. The truth is shrouded in obscurity, but that does not stop the fortune seekers who are occasionally seen digging in search of treasure.</p>\n<h2>POLITICS, LAW AND ORDER</h2>\n<p>The Icon City is the holy capital of the Church of the Icons, and the seat of power for the current Matriarch and Patriarch, two arch-prelates joined in symbolic union before the Icons. Of the two, most people hold the Matriarch, or the Icon Mother as she also is known, in highest regard.</p>\n<p>The arch-prelates are supported by the Herat Council, where religious matters for the system and the Horizon at large are made.

{"_id":"f7Ne90qCI7FDZkyL","name":"05 - Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CONFLICTS</h1>\n<h2>FALTERING FAITH</h2>\n<p>In the past few decades, the Church of the Icons has gained strength, momentum, and become increasingly more bureaucratic. It has sown its seeds and twisted its roots around all the rulers and principalities of the city-states - with the exception of the Chelebs-Menau family. Inspired by the growing power of the family, other houses have begun to rise up against the Church. Conflicts that were previously resolved by studying the Icons and heeding the Church’s counsel are now solved pragmatically without the aid of the Church. This change in behavior is suspected to be fuelled by the recent arrival of the Zenithians. Negotiation, trade, and too many fingers in the hummus pot, seems to be the spirit of the new age.</p>\n<p>The city of Ahare, which has long enjoyed the splendor of its station as a producer of fine wines, was the first to stand up to the Church of the Icons, expelling the Church's most respected delegate from Ahare. The wrath of the Icons did not take long; a month later, the ruling house Indraska was decimated by Frisian fever, and within weeks the new rulers found themselves begging for the city to be welcomed back into the familiar arms of the Church.</p>\n<h2>ON GRAVITON WINGS</h2>\n<p>The shipyards in the Icon City and the foundries of Antmira are undergoing feverish improvements. The Chelebs corporation seems to be ramping up their production capabilities system-wide, and some say that their sudden influx of birr is sponsored by foreign factions. Like bees to honey, faction agents swarm to Mira to find out what they’re building, and why the security forces at the Chelebs shipyards have been authorized to use lethal force to keep intruders at bay. Dramora Chelebs, the matriarch of the family and head of the Chelebs corporation is tight-lipped about the matter, and probing questions from the Church have been met with dismissive silence.</p>\n<h2>THE HARSH LIFE OF A PILGRIM</h2>\n<p>Life for pilgrims on Mira is not without difficulty. While the Icon City is full of temples, memorials, and monasteries, the unprepared face many dangers. Both in the City and on the Golden Plain, criminals and slavers prey on unwary pilgrims. To curb these attacks, punishments for such crimes are extremely severe. The Okra Darma recently learned this; one of their gangs paid for their slaving ways with their lives at the hands of the Weeping Matriarchy.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"fon1muYJWSQVgNrZ","name":"08 - Points of Interest","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>POINTS OF INTEREST</h1>\n<p>For most foreigners, Mira is synonymous with the Icon City. But the Icons have blessed the planet with many more wonders, such as the Golden Plain of Hamara, the Yevas ravine, the monastery island of Servi-mas, the Silk Forests, and the Leaning Mountain, to name a few.</p>\n<h2>THE GOLDEN PLAIN</h2>\n<p>From the gates of the Icon City to the slopes of Mount Sumra lies the Golden Plain of Hamara. The Golden Plain consists of both cultivated fields and vast, untamed swathes, where everything from grain to yafra-grass grows wild and abundant. Several city-states dot the coastline like the beads of a necklace, interconnected by the old railway network built by the very first colonizers. The further out one travels, the more the roads devolve into narrow and winding pilgrim trails that leave bright red lines in the wavy grass due to the iron-rich soil of the plains.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the plain sits the Pilgrim’s Serai, a once tiny village that has turned into a major caravan camp with its own spaceport. Only smaller ships are allowed to land here, forcing most pilgrims to travel to the Icon City before setting off on their pilgrimage.</p>\n<p>A tribe of humanites call the Golden Plain their home. The ebony-skinned Tugul people live around the Serai and among the sacred cliffs to the west. They are a peculiar sight for visitors, riding across the plains on bionically modified horses, with short legs and armored bodies. As the Serai has grown it has started to encroach upon the sacred rocks and water wells of the Tugul, resulting in tense stand-offs. A group of pilgrims was recently beaten by furious Tuguls, supposedly for intruding on their land. A separate group of pilgrims later disappeared, and while most blame the Tuguls, the Tuguls themselves blame the Yal-Shir - the Ensnarer. In response to the current state of unrest, the Church has dispatched a small company of the Weeping Matriarchy to the Serai to restore order to the Golden Plain.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE INVOKER STONE</h3>\n<p>Anxiety is spreading among the people of the Pilgrim’s Serai after a Tugul woman was found strangled in an alley. Only the swift intervention of Watch-Captain Khia Noums from the Weeping Matriarchy prevented the breakout of hostilities, and now a tense calm has settled over the camp as the warrior nuns hunt for the murderer. The spaceport has been closed and no pilgrims are allowed to leave.</p>\n<p>The murdered woman was a prophet of her people, and the guardian of the Invoker Stone; a Portal Builder artifact said to be able to summon Yal-Shir, the Ensnarer, and bind it to the will of its owner. A group of dockworkers, high on opor, claim to have witnessed a monstrous creature disappear into the space docks. Their description included a hide of knives and steel, and jaws large enough to crunch a dhol into nothing but scrap metal.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE ENSNARER</h3>\n<p>A popular legend in the system concerns Yal-Shir, the Ensnarer, who is said to seduce unworthy pilgrims, tempting them from their path, and then feasting upon their flesh and bone. Common lore dictates care should be used when traveling obscure or unused pilgrim trails, as the Ensnarer waits along these paths. On the Yadaman Trail, between the Icon City and the Valley of Monuments, several groups of pilgrims disappear every year, something that neither private mercenaries or the sisters of the Weeping Matriarchy have been able to prevent. The official version is that these disappearances are the work of robbers and Tugul brigands, but if any local is asked, they will tell you, there is only one culprit for these crimes, and it is unwise to scorn the Ensnarer.</p>\n<h2>THE SILK FORESTS</h2>\n<p>Along the northern foothills of Mount Sumra, where rainheavy clouds often gather, the Silk Forests grow and thrive . In fact, they are not forests in the true sense of the word, but rather vast areas of tall bamboo groves, a grass that reaches heights of ten to fifteen meters, with hard, stalk-like trunks.</p>\n<p>The forests provide an excellent environment for the silkworms that arrived with the first Miran colonizers, and there are several villages in the area where the larvae are cultivated and harvested. The silk is then shipped to the city of Tifret, where the noble house Ymirah has established a monopoly on silk handling in its countless textile factories, modeled after the industrial islands in the Conglomerate on Kua.</p>\n<p>Several smaller Zenithian manufacturers and subsidiaries have interests in Tifret, which has attracted representatives from the Consortium, the Free League and Chelebs-Menau. The latter are particularly interested in the silk that comes from a subspecies of the common larvae, with properties so unique it can be woven into a composite for use in ultralight exo shells and battlesuits.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"jFCOKNsNGZMBtXTq","name":"06 - People and Culture","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h1>\n<p>The Mirans are widely known for their open and carefree nature, something that stands in stark contrast to the teachings of the Icons. In reality, many Mirans take the Icons for granted, as their blessings have shined on Mira for as long as anyone can remember.</p>\n<h2>A MIRAN NEVER CARRIES AN EXTRA BURDEN</h2>\n<p>During the hot afternoons, the cities' parks, the villages' prophetic groves, and the monasteries' stone gardens are filled with calmly conversing or meditating people. Children play when the schools are closed, and street vendors take the opportunity to sell salted almonds, fried corn, and shish kebab to their relaxed customers. All this amounts to the perception that Mira is forevermoving at half speed. Miran cities truly come to life at night. After dusk, once the oppressive heat has lifted, the bazaars, spaceports and serais reopen to the sound of mischievous Macaques and chattering Sunbirds.</p>\n<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF ALMS</h2>\n<p>One of the most important decrees for a Miran is that of giving alms, either directly in the form of food or birr to monasteries, monks and pilgrims, or through gifts to the Church of the Icons, so that the Herat Council may better distribute the wealth to the weak and the poor.</p>\n<h2>MIRAN FASHION</h2>\n<p>While Zalosian attire isn’t often mentioned by Tara Kono’s fashion show, Mira has emerged as the fashion hotbed of the Third Horizon. Miran fashion often focuses on the extravagant and miraculous, as seen in the lines produced by the Chelebs-Menau fashion houses, where shawls and dresses float through the use of miniature grav-projectors.</p>\n<p>Even Miran everyday attire has become a talking point, with garments sewn from thin, gleaming silk, and undulating, ultralight synthetic materials. Greens, purples, and blues are very common, often in gradient combinations to mimic the iridescent tails of the Menauan Peafowl. Everyday attire is often carefully combined with detailed embroidery, gemstones, and ancestral jewellery.</p>\n<p>Miran workwear tends to consist of airy shalwar trousers and kameezes, though some Mirans exchange the kameez for a short vest, leaving the stomach bare. For finer occasions, people in prestigious positions bring out their achkan coats or sweeping choli dresses. When heads are not adorned with intricate gold-plated ornaments, they are often covered with thin shawls. Despite this extravagance, many Mirans always go barefoot to show solidarity with the wandering pilgrims.</p>\n<p>During Miran festivities, it is common for participants to adorn themselves with body paint. Piercings of any kind, however, are noticeable in their absence. Tattoos are often looked down upon as what many believe to be art one day, may not be well suited for the next.</p>\n<h2>MUSIC AND LEARNING</h2>\n<p>No matter where your bare feet take you on Mira, you will notice that silence never finds you. Harmonic tones constantly flow from temples, chai houses, dholes, and stores. It is also commonplace for businesses to hire musicians in order to entertain their customers throughout the day.</p>\n<p>With music being so common, it may come as a surprise that there are no musical recordings or broadcasts originating from Mira. Inspired by the philosophies of Alahm’s Temple, most Mirans see music as something that simply cannot be captured, but must be experienced first hand. To record a song is to diminish its value.</p>\n<p>Mirans are not solely considered to be a musical people, but also a highly educated one. But instead of receiving their education from impersonal Zenithian universities, they go to learn from revered teachers known as Swami; older mirans who share their knowledge and experiences. Swamis don’t simply teach young Mirans to read and count, to paint, dance, and play the Tambura, but also valuable life lessons, philosophy, and ethics. Some Swami take on dozens of students, while the most distinguished masters from the highly regarded monasteries only take on one student at a time. The noble houses all fight for these deeply coveted spots for their children, but most masters are said to only consider what goes on between a student’s ears, not whether they happen to be a Chelebs-Menau or Ymirah.</p>\n<p>The monasteries of Mira function as centres for higher learning, and every Miran politician and bureaucrat once started out as a novice. Common people may attend monastery schools for shorter periods, to learn more about the ways of the faithful and to get closer to the Icons.</p>\n<h2>MIRAN WINE</h2>\n<p>Great vineyards can be found all over Mira, and in the gastronomic night’s sky, Miran wines are considered to be the brightest stars of them all. Each city-state has their own specialty, and produces everything from dry whites, to deep, full-bodied reds, and the sweet moonlit wines whose grapes are grown in the cold light of Mira’s moons.</p>\n<p>Nestled among the vineyards are steep chai plantations, an absolute necessity given that their flowers are used for the fragrant Jevvan-Pannee rosewater used as seasoning at every Miran dinner table.</p>\n<p>The Mirans themselves eat very little, as a slender figure is highly prized and gluttony is seen as a lack of discipline. Common dishes range from spiced rice puddings and smooth broth, preferably with fried bread and edible floral arrangements.</p>\n<h2>THE FESTIVAL OF THE DANCER</h2>\n<p>During the last night of the Dancer’s segment, the Icon City erupts in festivities where thousands of Mirans perform the Girfa, a dance ritual which mainly consists of elaborate whirlings. As the Girfa goes on, some prophets have been known to enter a trance where they claim to see the smiling face of the Dancer. For foreign pilgrims, the advanced maneuvers of the dance usually end in dizziness or nausea, much to the Mirans’ great pleasure.</p>\n<h2>THE NIGHT OF THE PILGRIMS</h2>\n<p>The Night of the Pilgrims is the Traveler’s response to the Festival of the Dancer, and is celebrated during the holy Pilgrimaria at the end of the Judge’s segment. The festival is dedicated to the many visitors who flock to Mira and the Icon City.</p>\n<p>By tradition, the sacred rite of almsgiving is highly regarded during the night, which means that food and drink are heavily discounted, or even offered for free - which often leads to as much rowdiness as the festival dedicated to the Dancer. On rare occasions, the Night of Pilgrims has even turned into an intoxicated riot, only to be reigned in by the grim watchmen of the Temple Guard.</p>\n<h2>FLOWER DAY</h2>\n<p>Mira is widely known for its exotic flowers which are highly valued in both the Monolith on Kua and among the Dars of Dabaran. The holiday plays a huge role in The Icon Church’s celebration of fertility, which has been adapted to the seasons of Mira.</p>\n<p>The preparations for Flower Day are extensive. For weeks, everyone from commoners, monks, and the privileged travel to the countryside to pick flowers which are later used to dress buildings, dholes, and spaceships. Many Mirans are conceived during the holiday.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

The floating churches, chapels, and monasteries are themselves dwarfed by the massive colony ship, ‘The Blessing of Huraba’, where the Dome of The Icons and the Herat Council are situated.</p>\n<p>The Dome is built directly onto the hull of the ancient spaceship, and with it’s blue, vaulted roof, and eight majestic prayer towers it has become the universal symbol for Mira, and the unquestionable might of the Church of the Icons.</p>\n<p>Every morning, the entire city reverberates with the ringing of a thousand church bells as the Dome descends to the Pilgrim Square. There, innumerable pilgrims and envoys await the arrival of the floating island, eager to experience the breathtaking mosaic roof of the dome, discuss important matters with the Herats, or even attend an audience with the Icon Mother herself.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE GUARDIAN AND THE ABOMINATION</h3>\n<p>On the slopes leading to the Temple City, at the mouth of a wide staircase by the Pilgrims’ Square, there are two giant statues that were brought down from the eastern mountains by giant haulers. One statue represents the Judge, defiantly raising her sword toward the skies, and the other is the Dancer, locked in a fiery pose.</p>\n<p>At first glance this portrayal seems unremarkable, but upon closer inspection one will come to find the Dancer has been cursed with a third arm. The curiousness of this oddity is the simple fact that this statue was not always malformed in this way. For its enormous size, there is no plausible explanation for the haulers to have missed the third arm, but none can recall when it appeared, as though their collective memory has been distorted by mystical, perhaps heretical force. The revelation continues to embarrass the Church, given their outwardly negative stance towards the Humanites the arm resembles. The Icon Mother, through shame and rage, has ordered the extra appendix to be obscured by a giant copper construction.</p>\n<h2>THE CITY OF BRICKS</h2>\n<p>The City of Bricks rises out of the slums like an island. Its buildings are packed tight against each other - so tight one might assume the entire district to consist of one massive structure. While nearly every building is made from the red clay of the Golden Plains, there’s very little uniformity in shape and height. Wiring and cables cover every surface and washlines block out the sky to leave the narrow alleyways in a perpetual gloom. Many residents use umbrellas to protect themselves from the ceaseless dripping of leaking and corroded water pipes.</p>\n<p>The western parts of the district faces the ocean and the Chelebs dockyards. Here, thousands of fishing dhols are moored to the buildings like colorful flags, gently waving in the wind.</p>\n<p>The City of Bricks is best known as an enclave for criminal activity, and while the Okra Darma have a strong presence running protection rackets, smuggling operations and brothels, this only tells one side of the story. Despite the lack of space and constant power outages, the district is remarkably productive, mainly due to the many artisans who call the city their home.</p>\n<h2>THE PORT</h2>\n<p>On the hill overlooking the Intrapelagic Sea lies the Icon City’s port. The architecture is more varied here, with the reddish-brown clay buildings of the slums clashing with more lavish neo-Zenithian constructions. Due to the massive presence of the Chelebs-Menau family, the district is also known as Chelebs City.</p>\n<p>The port itself functions as both a seaport and a spaceport. Large atmospheric landers and courier ships are parked next to giant concrete platforms reaching out into the sea. The port is the largest commercial district in the city, and houses the Souk of the Merchant, where the Free League have their foothold in the system. Here, silk, bamboo, grain, and textiles can be purchased in bulk.</p>\n<p>The more exclusive port, Astra Merba, lies to the north and is used by rich dignitaries, ambassadors, and members of the noble houses. From balconies overflowing with exotic flowers one has a majestic view of the marina where giant catamarans, luxury dhols, and pleasure craft are moored. The artificial bay is equipped with grav projectors that keep the worst of the waves away during the annual monsoon season.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
