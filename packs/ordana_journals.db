{"_id":"1hrF5lLfNBCSYsd0","name":"05 - The Planet Ordana","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE PLANET ORDANA</h1>\n<p>The planet Ordana is almost entirely covered by polar ice caps. These extend from both poles almost to the planet's midsection. The equator is home to both settlers and indigenous tribes. The equatorial regions contain enormous swamps, windswept moors, and an almost inaccessible mountain chain. The most significant hub is the expanding industrial city of Ayuin, which houses the planet's most influential organisation – the Ayuin Cartel.</p>\n<h2>THE MENG DELTA</h2>\n<p>The mighty Meng Delta is situated where the Sie River meets the southern ocean Meriad. The area covers roughly a fifth of the equatorial region of Ordana. This wetland was settled by a late wave of poor colonists, and has remained a rural area without stable means of production due to its harsh environment.</p>\n<p>That changed with the expansion of the Consortium to Ordana. Since then, the Delta has experienced substantial growth. Unrefined goods like raw rubber and untreated silk, as well as soap and farmed fish, have become staples in the planet’s economy. Other goods, which earlier were unknown to the inhabitants, have also grown in popularity.</p>\n<h3>✺ BANZIN</h3>\n<p>A crop that has become increasingly common in the area is Banzin. This is a biosculpted plant that originated in a Cartel lab in Ayuin and has been forced on many farmers of the Delta. Banzin is a cross-fertilized plant made from mangrove trees and the Kuan Ekmek tree, whose green spherical stone fruits have a high protein content. The result is an enormous tree with tasteless fruits. The product has proven to handle vacuum drying well and has thus become popular in the expanding space trade of the Horizon.</p>\n<p>Several independent scientists have studied Banzin. They claim the plant still seems to be in a trial phase. The Ayuin Cartel disputes these claims. However, the plant has been blamed for a recent outbreak of a fungal infection in the Delta, which has destroyed crops of indigenous rice and made farmlands barren for an unforeseeable future.</p>\n<h3>✺ WANG-WANG</h3>\n<p>Life in the Meng Delta has alway been a struggle but with the Ayuin Cartel's demands and restrictions, it has become even harsher. The long work days have led to consumption of a drug made from Lei Wang. This beautiful, crimson flower was once held to be sacred. It’s long been known that a decoction of the flower gives a pain relieving high, but that frequent consumption causes mental deterioration. With new methods, the plant can be used to produde Wang-Wang, a drug similar to Opor. Wang-Wang has become a lucrative source of income for both smugglers and freedom fighters in the Delta.</p>\n<h2>THE VALLEY OF DEATH</h2>\n<p>The Myu Valley was once a verdant paradise filled with rice fields that meandered like a snake between the mountains. Today it's an environmental disaster zone, a calamity that is said to have been caused by the Ayuin Cartel and the Banzin crop. The farmers in the valley were among the first to abandon their traditional crops in favor of the biosculpted plant. Banzin was to make Ordana and the Ayuin Cartel wealthy. That dream was never realized: the plant mutated and became host to a vile species of spider larva. The parasites fed off the plant and spun pale webs across the fields and nearby villages. The whole valley was ravaged before action could be taken. Today, the Myu Valley is a dead swamp, uninhabitable and unusable to both people and beasts.</p>\n<h2>THE MASSANI TERRITORY</h2>\n<p>The Massani Territory is an inaccessible mountain range that stretches along the northern offshoot of the Plain of Ordos to the Gaba Desert, and dominates the tract of land until the mainland meets the northern ocean. Various clans and influential families control this region.</p>\n<p>The clans have put their internal grievances behind them to form a united front against the influences of the Consortium. Outsiders are generally regarded with suspicion. The clans have not always been so distrusting. In fact, the region was one of the first to open up trade with the Consortium. The Ayuin Cartel was allowed to engage in commerce and constructed trading posts along the mountain trails. The largest trading station, Maseba, almost became a small city at the foot of the mountains. This tolerance suffered an abrupt end when the chieftains, for unknown reasons, decided to evict their guests from the trading posts. The merchants of Maseba refused to leave the area, which in turn resulted in a massacre.</p>\n<p>The Ayuin Cartel has tried to use the attack in a recent recruitment drive. The campaign portrays the 30 Cartel soldiers stationed at Maseba, facing hordes of primitive clan warriors. While none of the soldiers made it out alive, the campaign slogan readily proclaims “They died bravely, defending the light of civilization”. The slogan has received a mixed reception around Ordana.</p>\n<h3>✺ HARMAND’S MONASTERY</h3>\n<p>A mission from the Circle of Seekers, Harmand’s Monastery has long inhabited the area, presumably since before the clans. The monastery can count its days from the first wave of colonization. The ascetics get along well with the clan leaders and often act as mediators in various disputes. The site is known for its skilled yogis, who with their long, arduous training are said to have complete mastery of their bodies. In recent years, many afflicted mystics have journeyed to the monastery to learn how to suppress their powers – or, perhaps, to master them.</p>\n<h2>THE PLAIN OF ORDOS</h2>\n<p>Between the Meng Delta and the Massani Territory lies the desolate and windswept Plain of Ordos. Many firstcome have put down their roots in this yellow-brown, endless sea of weeds and rocks. To these inhabitants the plains are known as Jarda – the land without bounds. Small family households grow hardened crops and keep as many mulberry trees as the local water sources allow. At one time, the landscape was dominated by larger groves of trees, but when the silk trade collapsed because the Cartel choked its lucrative production, all sizable plantations were abandoned. Now only mournful tree stumps can be found where once white and green formed a welcoming contrast to the plain’s earthy color palette.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE ORACLE BABA YARI</h3>\n<p>Deep in the plains stands a circular, temple-like structure of darkened cedar wood. Small bubbling springs of stale salt water give the area the almost unbearable stench of rotting weeds and submerged, decaying logs. Few visit this remote and inhospitable place. Inside the temple resides Baba Yari – the oracle of Ordos. She is unmovable and shackled, as if she has become one with her surroundings, ever growing and decomposing in a strange symbiosis. The Oracle is said to have resided here for many generations, watchful and filled with prophecies concerning the circle of life. It is claimed among the people of Ordos that Baba Yari foresaw the coming of the Consortium to Ordana. For the people of Ordos she is a symbol of the everchanging – that despite its hardships, life always endures.</p>\n<h3>✺ SAKA KUL</h3>\n<p>The lake Saka Kul is Ordos’ only significant water source. However, for the inhabitants of the plain, this lake won’t deliver any soothing respite from the baking sun. Saka Kul’s waters are salty, stagnant, and poisonous to even the most hardy of creatures. For industrious farmers, the lake offers a precious resource in the form of salt deposits that accrue along the lake's shore when water levels recede. Every other segment, small caravans appear from the mountains to barter with the inhabitants of the plains. For the inhabitants of Ordos, these caravans are the sole source of regular contact with the outside world.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"GUikRq3aortQYAzH","name":"02 - Groups and Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>GROUPS AND CONFLICTS</h1>\n<h2>THE TAO: THE MYSTERIOUS PEOPLE</h2>\n<p>The people of Ordana may seem fractured but they share a common, if cryptic, history. The majority of the planet's inhabitants call themselves “Tao”, and are said to share a common ancestor: The Tao family. The identity of this family has been lost in the shroud of history, but its impact on the planet Ordana is without question. Traces of the Tao family can be found all over the planet – from artifacts washed ashore on the banks of the Ayuin River to statues buried in the mineral rich soil of the Meng Delta. The most prominent trace, of course, is the abandoned city of Ayuttha, deep within the delta. The cause of the Tao family’s decline – and the reasons that its daughters and sons abandoned the civilization they created – remains an enigma to this day. The mysterious city has lent its name to the People's Army of Ordana.</p>\n<h2>THE ATAMANS</h2>\n<p>The other major group inhabiting the planet is the Atamans of the Plain of Ordos. The Atamans are divided into closely knit clans who can trace their lineage back to the first colonizers of Ordana. In the time before the isolating aftermath of the Portal Wars, it was not uncommon for strife to erupt between the clans, and the plains were washed red with blood from countless onslaughts. For a time it seemed as if the people of the grasslands stood at the brink of annihilation. Then, the three largest clans formed a truce to secure the future of Ordos. They elected a mutual arbiter, the Ataman – a magistrate that all the clans could turn to during times of turmoil. The autonomy of the clans was kept sacred but larger disputes were always decided by this impartial judge.</p>\n<h2>THE SALT TRADE</h2>\n<p>At one time, Ordana boasted a thriving salt trade. Older citizens of Ordana recall how the skies over the grasslands were filled with enormous Karamant airships, and how their shadows covered the fertile mulberry fields. Seemingly buoyed by the southbound winds, the airships made a stately journey to Ayuin with their precious cargo. It didn’t take long for the Zenithians to impact the salt trade. Once the most lucrative business on the planet, it’s now a languishing, backwater affair. Airships gave way to meagre salt crawlers – and today, only a few trawler caravans traverse the plains. Changes to the market, enacted by the Ayuin Cartel, have caused the salt trade to dry up and blow away on those same winds that kept the Karamant ships afloat. The ships themselves are now all but a memory. The few still seen over the Plain of Ordos are patrol ships in the service of the Ayuin Cartel.</p>\n<h2>THE PEOPLE'S ARMY OF ORDANA</h2>\n<p>The People’s Army of Ordana has established a strong base in the Meng Delta among small clusters of smuggler hideouts. Minor skirmishes between Cartel forces and rebel fighters occur daily, but these have yet to break out into open warfare. The hostile environment of the Delta has proven to be hard to conquer, and the Cartel forces struggle not only with the rebels, but also with the very forces of nature. The airspace over the Delta is under constant surveillance in an attemp to supress rebel activity. The Legion has provided aerial support in the form of a wing of Orcinus Strikecraft, flown by pilots from the Cartel’s own flight academy. The Legion has refused to fly the missions itself, as commanders feel that would threaten the fragile truce formed between the Legion, the Moguls of the Janhagir Fleet, and the Alabaster Council.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"PvauvK9EFKkKxCOC","name":"07 - Ayuin","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h2>AYUIN</h2>\n<p>The ever-growing city of Ayuin was a bustling marketplace long before the arrival of the Consortium and the founding of the Ayuin Cartel. It wasn’t long ago when convoys arrived from all corners of the planet, carrying goods and services to the verdant and peaceful hills by the Ayuin River. Since the founding of the Ayuin Cartel and its monopolistic takeover of Ordana, the majority of the small-scale commerce has disappeared in favour of industrial business deals made by grand merchants. The city is divided into three districts, named after the three grand bazaars of old.</p>\n<h3>✺ BARKUN</h3>\n<p>'The bazaar of cedar wood' used to be where the merchants of the Meng Delta traded goods from the forest. It was also where treated goods traded hands - everything from opals from the Massani Territory to dried fish from the bountiful waters of Sie Lake.</p>\n<h3>✺ XHIDAN</h3>\n<p>'The bazaar of the silkworm' was where traveling families from Ordos bartered silk cassocks of the highest quality, hand woven with unique patterns from each clan on the vast plain.</p>\n<h3>✺ SZEGHMET</h3>\n<p>The third and largest bazaar was 'the bazaar of friendship'. Here the tribes of Ordana gathered to exchange experiences, clear up disputes, and form trading contracts.</p>\n<h2>AYUIN TODAY</h2>\n<p>The impact of the old bazaars can still be seen in the city's neighborhoods, even if the unique character of the districts has been distorted by the addition of living quarters on top of the trading houses and newly built massive administrative buildings of stone and metal. Barkun has now transformed into the slum district, Xhidan to the merchants' stalls, and Szeghmet to the noble houses and the seat of power.</p>\n<p>The city came into shape almost entirely on the eastern shore of the Ayuin River, with the Gora Hills industrial landscape behind it. The Barkun bazaar’s twisting alleys and slanting wooden houses lie closest to the Gora Hills, while Xhidan's more refined gardens act as a floodgate into Szeghmet's carved stone palaces and broad avenues. The cityscape frequently shifts character – from furbished facades with columns of polished lapis lazuli and marble details to shoddy, worn wooden houses with 10 stories, often just a stone’s throw away from each other. Contributing to this feeling of structured chaos, the Legion’s training academy is located right in the middle of the city. Here, poor Tao are indoctrinated in the merciless discipline of the Legion. At a young age they are sent from the outbacks of Ordana to Ayuin to pursue a better life in the service of the Legion, but also to wage war on their own brothers and sisters in the battle against the People’s Army of Ordana.</p>\n<h2>THE GORA HILLS</h2>\n<p>In the slightly hilly area west of the housing districts, the leaders of the Tao people once met over mint-infused tea to discuss grievances, marry off their daughters and sons, and to secure peace. Nowadays, the region is dominated by the chimneys of industries that reach towards the toxic sky above. The Gora Hills have morphed into a heaving industrial landscape where the Ayuin Cartel's goods are pumped out at a furious rate, to the delight of the Consortium. Under slave-like conditions, poor Tao toil day and night to supply the Cartel and Consortium with resources for their continued expansion.</p>\n<h2>THE SPACE PORT</h2>\n<p>Ayuin’s growing means of production has meant that its many small, established space ports have become obsolete as the main means of outside interaction. The Ayuin Cartel has solved this issue of capacity with a shimmering new space port. Located by the eastern outskirts of the Gora Hills factories, it stands as the ultimate manifestation of the Cartel’s firm grip on the populace and resources of Ordana. A myriad of new employment opportunities causes long lines to form each morning, leading to improvised recruitment offices. There are always openings for stevedores and deckhands willing to work, and the great availability of impoverished citizens guarantees that there is always a steady stream of cheap labor. Despite the Cartel’s strict surveillance of vehicles traveling in and out of the region, it still common for adventurous free traders and visitors utilize the less well equipped space port at the outskirts of the Barkun bazaar.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"R0HJVAZu4Et4DSGX","name":"06 - Hayrangi","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>HAYRANGI</h1>\n<p>The star system's largest space station is Hayrangi, home of the Hayrangi Group. The financial collective is viewed as the primary competitor of the city of Ayuin and the Cartel, and have clashed with the two on multiple occasions. The Hayrangi Group has well established trade contracts with the Mogul clan Nasr-Jang, which has earned the group a respected status within the entire Ordana system. The group has, despite its mixed interests, invested sizable sums in Yuisin and the growing Xenon trade.</p>\n<p>Hayrangi takes the shape of two starfishes mounted on top of each other, rotating in opposite directions. The station is officially owned by the brothers Auros and Moro Jafar, who with their splendid pragmatism have endeavored to make the station seem like a neutral site. Their politics annoy the Ayuin Cartel but not the Consortium. The reason behind the Consortium's placidness is that Hayrangi is the only place in the Quadrant of the Pillar where the Consortium and the Moguls can practice commerce, albeit with assistance from the financial group’s envoys.</p>\n<p>The station’s security is run by the mercenary unit, the Crimson Tigers, which has its headquarters there. The Tigers operate not only throughout the Quadrant but also beyond – for example, in the Rimward Reach and on Mira.</p>\n<h2>A TOUR OF HAYRANGI</h2>\n<p>The Hayrangi space station contains several interesting locations. The station’s 12 arms house many docks designed to accommodate spacecraft of different models. This unusual arrangement means Hayrangi does not have a centralized space port. To traverse the enormous station, rickshaws in varying shapes are often used.</p>\n<h3>✺ SAYINDA’S RICKSHAW EMPIRE</h3>\n<p>Sayinda is a woman who started her career with two strong legs and two sharp ears – uniting both transportation and information sharing into one lucrative trade. Today she rules over the taxi business and information trading on the station.</p>\n<h3>✺ DUDUK’S EMPORIUM</h3>\n<p>In the station's grandest bazaar lies the renowned Duduk’s Emporium, an antique shop that sells the most eldritch relics and artefacts from all the corners of the Horizon. It is not uncommon for Duduk to look for brave free traders to acquire a facemask from Sadaal, a reliquary from Melik, or Icon-art from Enau. All for a reasonable price, of course.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE DWELLING OF THE NIGHTINGALE</h3>\n<p>The dwelling is home to the financial elite of the station, and is a restricted area. Entry is only available by invitation. The residents of the district call themselves the Hayrangi Group, a cooperative that strives for the benefit of the station and for mutual assistance in different projects throughout the Quadrant of the Pillar.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE DOVE TREE</h3>\n<p>This is a spa that tends to weary individuals – if they have the birr to gain admission. The Dove Tree has a reputation of being the only cure against the melancholy that affects those who realize that they can't take their wealth and power to the next life. Members of the Council of Factions and the dars of Dabaran feature amongst its clientele. Kalia Jang is the founder of the Dove Tree and its chief medicurg. There are whispers that one of her patients is one of the station's twin despots – Moro Jafar.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

Merchants passing through the Quadrant of the Pillar tend to travel via Ordana rather than the inhospitable Sivas system. Since the Alabaster Council has made the Altai system an unwelcoming place for the ships of the Consortium and its allies, Ordana has become the obvious choice for Zenithian organizations to establish themselves.</p>\n<p>Many of the events in the system’s history are related to its main planet, Ordana. This is home to the Ayuin Cartel - but also to the cartel’s adversaries, the Hayrangi Group and its dignitaries. During the last cycle, Ordana saw the birth of a growing rebel movement: the People's Army of Ordana, also known as Ayuttha’s Leopards. The rebels are tired of the Ayuin Cartel’s manipulation of the economy and they believe taking up arms is the only way forward. The Ayuin Cartel has responded by recruiting more soldiers to its ranks, and it’s expected that the central planet of the system will soon be wrought in the flames of war.</p>\n<h2>THE UNCOMELY BROTHER</h2>\n<p>Yuisin have often been described either as “the uncomely brother” or “the inept sister”, as the system is underdeveloped and lawless. The only destination that draws visitors is the Palace of the Slumbering Prophet.</p>\n<p>The system has recently witnessed a surge in colonization thanks to the discovery of large deposits of Xenon. The Ayuin Cartel in Ordana – afraid of losing its newfound power – is doing its best to undermine the colonization effort, which has resulted in unrest in the neighboring system. Yuisin is home to many loosely formed power coalitions in Yuisin – often ruled by a morza, mepeta or malik.
