{"_id":"6FakIhUSBCtNTKZV","name":"02 - History of Zalos","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>HISTORY OF ZALOS</h1>\n<p>The origins of The Order date back to the exodus from the Second Horizon by a group of dogmatic warrior monks. They called themselves the Order of the Pariah, having been cast out because of their fervent faith in the Martyr as the ultimate saviour of humankind.</p>\n<p>They were drawn to Zalos because of the celestial phenomenon that is now known as “The Crown of the Martyr”, a system-wide solar wind said to enhance prophetic visions. The Order believed (and continues to believe) that the Crown is the Martyr leading his followers to a home among the stars. Over the centuries, The Order has turned the entire system into a temple dedicated the Icon.</p>\n<p>Very little is known about the early years of The Order, only that the deep faith that burns within the hearts of Zalosians today burned bright even then. Zalosians were heavily involved in the Portal Wars, raising the banners of the Martyr and singing to his glory beneath skies of blood and fire. There was no doubt that they alone were the true faithful.</p>\n<p>During the war, the Zalosian system went into full lockdown while her holy warriors waged their bloody crusade across the Horizon. After the Long Night, The Order grudgingly joined the emergent empires of the Third Horizon and took up a seat at the Council of Factions on Coriolis, relaying the warnings from their prophets about the return of darkness and strife.</p>\n<p>In CC60, the Emissaries of Xene appeared. Overnight, Zalos recalled their ambassadors home and locked down their system once more – a chilling echo of the old war. Zalos is now under complete lockdown by The Martyr Fleet, which performs extensive system-wide monitoring and patrol operations. The only route not closed to visitors is the one leading to the City of Foreigners on Karrmerruk. The Martyr Fleet’s presence is heaviest around Zahedan to stop rebels from leaving the planet.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"name":"08 - Places of Interest","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PLACES OF INTEREST</h1>\n<h2>HALLS OF KORAZAN</h2>\n<p>The largest trade deals always take place in the Halls of Korazan, located on the outskirts of the commerce district, next to the spaceport. It is a large complex of halls and warehouses solely devoted to foreign trade, each of which takes on the distinct attributes of the wares traded there.</p>\n<p>For instance, 'The Basin' is characterized by a smell of salt and seaweed, and loud merchants auctioning off large hauls of exotic fish from the Zalosian oceans. The green market is characterized by the chirping of birds and the murmuring negotiations of merchants, while deals for the precious metals used in ship propulsion systems are made in a heavily guarded area known as The Forge. Agents from the Draconite faction have been seen here, making deals on minerals and silicates used for their terrifying Meson weaponry.</p>\n<h2>THE SOUK OF MISTS</h2>\n<p>The Souk of Mists is located under the City of Foreigner’s second-largest dome, named after the constant fog that covers the bazaar at the center of the district, as well as the surrounding blocks. The souk is a bustling marketplace with narrow alleys and tiny plazas. Visitors from all across the Horizon can mingle with the locals here, take a break in the small Kawah shops or listen to the street musicians. Several stores and restaurants are run by outsiders, who have sworn fealty to the Martyr and provide the residents of the moon with food and products not manufactured in the Zalos system. The magistrates keep a constant vigil in this district, as the Souk is deemed to be a prime target for the heretics of Zahedan.</p>\n<h2>THE 11TH OSSUARY</h2>\n<p>The smallest dome of the city houses the 11th Ossuary. This is one of the largest bone chambers in the system, but its halls are barren compared to the ancient ossuaries on Zalos. Very few inhabitants are actually born on Karrmerruk, and their remains are usually brought back to Zalos. Instead, the 11th Ossuary houses the remains of notable prophets, brave martyrs and mighty generals from the Portal Wars.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of rumours surrounding the ossuary, the most persistent one claims that it contains the bones of actual portal builders. Anyone foolish enough to utter these rumors in the City of Foreigners can expect a visit from the Magistrates.</p>\n<h2>THE HAMMER OF THE MARTYR</h2>\n<p>The battlecruiser “The Hammer of the Martyr” keeps an endless vigil above the city. The giant ship is a constant reminder of the strength and technological superiority of The Martyr Fleet, with its mighty towers, spires and weapon systems. Its hull is covered by glyph armor, a marvelous invention that constantly shifts in fractal structures, causing severe headaches to the unfamiliar observer. The aft features a glowing sphere contained by a contraption shaped like a horse-shoe: the much sought after antimatter drive that is far superior to the technologies used by other factions in the Horizon.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nRie7LEo31St9hvS":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.T4K69Y5BLV1RKOwT"}},"_id":"9Om3p3Qca5Wrzg7N"}

{"_id":"iIiyxrEEpCHl1EBN","name":"05 - People and Culture","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h1>\n<h2>LIFE ON ZALOS</h2>\n<p>The population of Zalos can be divided into two distinct groups: those living in cities and those living in the countryside. All major communities are built around large monastery cloister complexes from which the Pariah maintains control of the area. The monasteries are often home to hundreds of members of the Order, and are always heavily fortified. Every day, the people of the community make a pilgrimage to the monastery where they attend ceremonies and perform self-flagellation in the name of the Martyr.</p>\n<p>Zalosian cities are built of stone, with prayer towers, high pointed roofs, narrow alleys and few open areas. This grim legacy from the Portal Wars ensures that the cities are difficult to take from the air, forcing an attacker to land outside the city or try to breach the landing pads in the monasteries. The cities on Zalos are well-populated and labyrinthine, in contrast to the cities on Zahedan, which have been reduced to crumbling stone and dust from the Civil War.</p>\n<p>The inhabitants of the countryside live simple, rural lives bordering on the primitive. They raise crops among the rolling hills, fish from the great seas, and hunt in the forests and among the mountains. Vast river deltas are occupied by huge aquafarms that provide the nobility of the Horizon with exotic fish. The common Zalosian rarely has any access to the advanced technology of The Order and many of the everyday trinkets on Coriolis would be seen as rare or exotic.</p>\n<h2>TRAVEL</h2>\n<p>The cities and oil fields of Zalos are interconnected by a simple train system which winds its way through mountains, forests, and deserts. The countryside sees wide use of horse and carriage transportation, alongside repurposed troop carriers from the armed forces. The technology level is relatively low, especially outside the cities, and people make do with whatever they have. Daily suffering is just another tribute to the Martyr.</p>\n<p>The common person who wants to enjoy a more luxurious way of travel uses the airship routes that criss-cross the planet. Zalosians of wealth tend to have their own airship for planetary transports. More advanced alternatives, like aircraft and grav transports are reserved for the priesthood and military personnel. Armed gunboats patrol the skies even on Zalos, ever watchful for rebel activity.</p>\n<h2>ENTERTAINMENT</h2>\n<p>The Order have successfully blocked out the Bulletin from broadcasting in the system, and all holo-channels are instead filled with hourly sermons or news reports from the immensely popular (and party faithful) Zaladi Hafsou. Another popular form of entertainment are historical dramas: The Eternal Radiance follows the crew of a monastery cruiser during the final stages of the Portal Wars, while The Great Sacrifice is aimed for children, teaching them about the heroes of The Order through song and poetry.</p>\n<h2>HYMNS TO THE MARTYR</h2>\n<p>Singing is important on Zalos, mainly in religious gatherings but also in everyday life. Many Zalosians are choir members, and their gatherings are as much about singing as they are about socializing. Families and friends get together for hours and sing their praise to the Martyr. The songs are never accompanied by musical instruments and are usually dismally sombre, or take the form of grand epics retelling events of the past.</p>\n<p>To be chosen to sing in the chapels and monasteries of The Order is seen as a great honor. These choirs are always led by priests, themselves chosen from among the choirs by showing extraordinary devotion to the teachings of the Martyr. The Samaritans on Coriolis have their own choir, whose monophonic vocals can be heard from both the hospital and the sanatorium.</p>\n<h2>RELICS AND OSSUARIES</h2>\n<p>The signs of the faithful are ever present in the system. The Zalosians wear tiny bone relics, and the teachings of the Martyr are carefully penned down on parchment and placed next to doors and airlocks.</p>\n<p>Every cloister complex houses a Tower of Silence, where, the dead are put to rest. Their bodies are consumed by insects and birds until the bones are ready to be placed in the local bone chamber, or ossuary, a holy place where the last remains of the faithful are interred next to the great heroes and prophets of old. The ossuary is usually connected with the local monastery, but in some remote areas it is built in hidden glades or caverns. Ossuaries are only accessible to priests or family members of the deceased.</p>\n<h2>ZALOSIAN FASHION</h2>\n<p><em>“The fashion trend of the Martyrs seems to be as black and white as the world view of their priesthood”. </em></p>\n<p>- Tara Kono, from the bulletin fashion show “Veils of gold”.</p>\n<p>The Zalosians almost exclusively dress in black and white, to the degree that other colors are seen as sinful extravagance. Common clothing includes kaftans, loosely fitted kameezes, and wide, pleated , skirt-like pants known as hakamas. The fabric tends to be heavy and thick, often embroidered with silver or tin. The embroidery forms protective prayers and scriptures celebrating the deeds of famous martyrs. Zalosian clothes are often asymmetric, and it is not uncommon for garments to lack an arm piece or for pants to be more tapered to one of the legs.</p>\n<p>In addition to their sombre attire, Zalosians are widely known for their relaxed disposition to nudity, and it is very common for Zalosians to show their bare back, chest, legs, or arms. The scripture says that one should never be ashamed of “the scars of devotion”, in reference to the ritual self-flagellation performed by the faithful. There’s a saying among traders and negotiators that a transparent argument or transaction is, “like a Zalosian kaftan: it hides nothing!”</p>\n<h2>FOOD AND ALCOHOL</h2>\n<p>Much can be said about the harshness of The Order of the Pariah regime, but when it comes to food and dining, the common Zalosian enjoys a diet worthy of the highest priest. All meals are served within the cloister complexes, and the meals (that are often spiced with saffron, plums and sumac) are shared equally between commoner and priest.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is strictly forbidden within the system, and drunkards are mercilessly brought in front of their peers and flogged publicly.</p>\n<p>The Order has something of a split attitude when it comes to drugs. Most see them as a poison that breaks down the true faith of the people. Others see them as an opportunity to get closer to their Icon, something one would normally only achieve through deep prayer or self-flagellation. The Martyr Council remains silent on the issue, and looks the other way when it comes to sects like the Children of Kianaar, whose members rarely leave their drug-induced hazes.</p>\n<h3>✺ KIANAAR’S SPICERY</h3>\n<p>The Children of Kianaar control the trade of herbs, mushrooms, and synthetic intoxicants in the system. Before the lockdown of Zalos, the Children of Kianaar were rumored to deal with the Syndicate and other shadowy organizations on Coriolis. Today, their business is in decline and the sect has retreated to three locations in the system: a hidden den in the City of Foreigners on Karrmerruk, a small mining village on Zalos itself, and an old space station at the edge of the system.</p>\n<p>This station, known as Kianaar’s Spicery, enjoys an almost mythical status in the underworld of the Horizon. Drug connoisseurs travel here from far and wide to enjoy the decoctions and mixtures produced by the sect. While the drugs are of the highest quality, the reputation of the station certainly isn’t. More than one traveling aristocrat has lost both wallet and life in the station’s dark corridors.</p>\n<h2>LIFE ON ZAHEDAN</h2>\n<p>The living conditions on Zalos and Zahedan are as different as night and day. Zahedan is in the grips of a civil war. The rebels have swayed large swathes of the population to their cause, and the innocent are stuck in a crossfire between two sides doing their utmost to obliterate each other. The Order don't waste any time making distinctions between combatants and non-combatants, a fact that drives large numbers of the population into the arms of the rebels. Even cities far away from the frontlines are beset by Order strike craft on a daily basis, and the citizens are getting used to spending their nights in shelters and basements.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure on Zahedan is in complete shambles. The train network is obliterated, the airspace is a contested warzone, and the roads are covered with craters from endless artillery barrage. Everything that moves is a potential target for the two sides in the conflict.</p>\n<p>Despite these differentiating living conditions, the populations of the two planets have much in common. Prayer and self-flagellation are important on both Zalos and Zahedan, and faith defines every aspect of life, be it family relationships, daily work, or war.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE GREAT THIRST</h3>\n<p>The vast desert known as Marak Zildahn (The Great Thirst) stretches across the northern hemisphere of Zahedan. It features long rolling dunes and windswept rocks, and used to be the least populated area of the planet even before the war. Today, the desert is controlled by The Order, who uses the monastery fortress of Anninu as their staging point for the ongoing conflict.</p>\n<p>Its kilometer-long walls and massive towers rise high above the desert, and the fortress itself is always surrounded by strike craft and landers on their way to, or back from a mission. Rebels have tried to take the fortress several times to no avail, and the many burnt out vehicle columns littering the desert are a testament to their failure.</p>\n<p>Abandoned mineral oil refineries can be found at the outskirts of the desert, serving as forward bases for the Martyrs’ reconnaissance pilots.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

Few are as insidious as the so-called “Spiders of Indra.” They lie dormant, hidden among asteroid fields or orbiting dead planets. From a distance, they look like bright, asymmetrical geometric structures that flicker through space. No one knows what attracts these weapons, only that ships that are attacked are torn into pieces.</p>\n<p>Some say that the reason why The Martyr Fleet hasn’t bombed Zahedan into oblivion is because of secret weapon labs containing terrifying bionic weapons that could awaken from the bombardment.</p>\n<h2>THE CROWN OF THE MARTYR</h2>\n<p>At irregular intervals, storms rage across Zalos-A, lacerating the entire system with strong solar winds. During these storms, a jagged pattern is visible around the star, like white thorns against the black void. The Order call this phenomenon The Crown of the Martyr.</p>\n<p>Among the Order it is accepted as fact that storm prophecies are especially accurate and ominous. Even the non-believers in the Foundation have observed that the phenomenon associated with the Crown is occurring with shorter intervals, a sign that The Order themselves interpret as the coming of the end times.</p>\n<p>The Crown has more than one religious significance. When the storms reach their peak they affect electronic systems all over the system. To counter this, The Order have designed ships and weapons that can handle momentary lapses - but it’s far worse for foreigners whose ships get knocked out and start to drift helplessly through the system. Horror stories tell about ships who drift into clusters of Indra Spiders and other bionic atrocities, only to disappear forever.</p>\n<h2>FALAKIAN FIRES</h2>\n<p>On every major celestial body in the Zalos system travellers may encounter what are known as “Falakian Fires”. On Zalos they can be encountered hovering over grassy hills. The inhabitants of Zahedan hide in demolished buildings while fires glide along the streets. From the domes of the City of Foreigners one may spot them drifting around in the barren lunar landscape. They usually appear and disappear spontaneously, but there are also examples such as the Katoomi ravine on Zahedan where they have been seen for decades.</p>\n<p>Those who are touched by the floating flames suffer different fates. Some are torn into pieces, or burned into ashes. Others are driven into madness and spend the rest of their days mumbling about “the children of the ashes”.</p>\n<p>The nature of the fires remains a mystery even for the adepts of The Order. They seem to have existed long before the Portal Wars, probably even before Zalos was colonized. Everyone who has studied the phenomenon agrees that while the fires aren’t self-aware, they definitely show signs of intent and purpose.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"moPB0kYSObjsZVrE","name":"03 - Zalosian Groups","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>ZALOSIAN GROUPS</h1>\n<h2>THE MARTYR COUNCIL</h2>\n<p>Zalos is ruled by The Martyr Council. The Council is an everchanging group of priests, prophets, grandmasters, and elders who gather on the Belit-Sheri – the Parchment Ship. It is no secret that the Council makes use of archaic rites and divination but despite its methods it remains the biggest power structure in the system and its word is law.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE POWER OF PROPHECY</h3>\n<p>There are countless examples of battles and events that have been predicted in old texts or in the mumbled words of entranced priests. Each monastery contains a collection of carefully catalogued prophecies from the local area. These are later picked up by the Belit-Sheri. This cruiser travels along an ancient route between Zalos, Zahedan, and the major space stations, closely guarded by elements of The Martyr Fleet.</p>\n<p>Several times each cycle The Martyr Council gathers on Belit-Sheri to interpret the prophecies in rituals and debates that can last for weeks. Recently all signs have pointed to the same conclusion: the Darkness is returning to the Third Horizon.</p>\n<h2>THE COLD FLAME</h2>\n<p>The Cold Flame is one of The Order’s strongest warrior cults, with a history datting back over several centuries. It is therefore peculiar that the entire cult has decided to stay out of the conflict raging on Zahedan. Some say the members are biding their time within their fortress monastery Amshaar, waiting for their grandmaster Samesh Alim to declare the arrival of the end times and the final crusade against the Darkness.</p>\n<h2>THE ANIMATHEURGES</h2>\n<p>Very few understand the intricacies of bionics like the animatheurges of Zalos. Due to animatheurgy’s immense capabilities, its creators are highly regarded and kept safe in hidden temples all across Zalos. In airtight catacombs deep within the mountains, they sculpt forms out of material that is said to be alive – maybe even self-aware. There are corporations within the Consortium who would trade entire colonies for the scrap material from animatheurge experiments.</p>\n<h2>THE ARCHIVISTS</h2>\n<p>The Archivists, like their brethren The Samarites on Coriolis, are one of the few groups among The Order not seen as crazed fanatics by the people of the Horizon. Their holy mission is to gather, interpret, and enshrine relics from the Portal Wars. Much was lost in the wars, but scattered fragments of information exist across the Horizon. The Archivists hope to find and secure these fragments before foreigners discover forbidden technologies that The Order wants to keep secret.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"qGkFDUgiwJLSFYL7","name":"01 - Home of the Martyrs","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>HOME OF THE MARTYRS</h1>\n<p>The firstcome faction ‘The Order of The Pariah’ has ruled Zalos with an iron fist for as long as anyone can remember, and it is very restrictive as to who it lets in. Periodically, the system has enjoyed stable albeit stiff relations with the rest of the Horizon, but the arrival of the Emissaries changed everything.</p>\n<p>What little information is known about Zalos today usually comes from rumours or third party sources, and the few who have actually visited the system can only share their experiences from the City of Foreigners.</p>\n<h2>THE ZALOSIAN SYSTEM</h2>\n<p>Zalos is a binary system with two habitable planets, Zalos and Zahedan (also called Zalos-B) - each orbiting its own star. A third planet, Benagia, suffered horribly from bombardment during the Portal Wars and is still considered to be uninhabitable. A few moons in the system are colonized, the most famous being Karrmerruk, which orbits Benagia and is the home to the City of Foreigners.</p>\n<p>Scattered across the system are dozens of space stations of various sizes and purposes. These stations range from smaller outposts consisting of interconnected haulers, to the enormous cloister station Manaat, which was boarded and purged in the initial phase of the ongoing civil war and left orbiting Zahedan in silent majesty.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE CHORAL STATIONS</h3>\n<p>The Order of the Pariah consists of hundreds of smaller sects and sub-orders. One of these groups goes by the name ‘The Hymn of the End Times” and is responsible for the socalled ‘Choral Stations’ – eight behemoths evenly distributed around the system.</p>\n<p>Every day of the Zalosian standard cycle, the Hymnist choirs and flagellants gather in ingeniously constructed halls to sing their praise to The Martyr. Throughout these reverberant chambers, a chorus of screaming flagellants and polyphonic choirs is transmitted across open frequencies throughout the system. Visiting traders have been known to shut down their comms completely to escape this haunting, ethereal cacophony.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"xQyREEKW3qxypOhZ","name":"07 - Karrmerruk","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>KARRMERRUK</h1>\n<p>The moon Karrmerruk lies in orbit around the dead planet Benagia, not far from the portals of the Zalos system. Since the lockdown of Zalos went into effect, the City of Foreigners on Karrmerruk has become the only place in the system where off-worlders are allowed to trade. The city is ruled by one of the most progessive elders of the Martyrs Council, who is responsible for maintaining trade relations with the rest of the Horizon.</p>\n<p>The city consists of a number of domes, arranged in the shape of a sickle - one of the holy symbols of The Order. The atmosphere outside of the domes is cold and free of oxygen. The architecture of the districts within the domes varies, but everything follows the aesthetics of The Order. Everything is built in stone, with winding stairs leading to courtyards adorned with rippling fountains. Hanging plants cover pointed roofs and old stonework from the time before the Portal Wars. Magnificent mosaics tell the stories of the Order and the laws of the Martyr. Open spaces are largely absent, except in the city’s many spaceports where large cargo ships can land unhindered.</p>\n<h2>CULTURE AND TRADE</h2>\n<p>Newcomers to the City of Foreigners often suffer from the misconception that it is a trade paradise far from the iron hand of the fanatical Martyrs. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>Incoming ships need to be processed by the Zalos portal station, and all crews need to apply for the proper permits before being able to visit the city. Not being able to present approved documentation while in the city will lead to interrogations with the Magistrates, followed by a swift and permanent travel ban to the system.</p>\n<p>Large-scale business with the Order is only allowed in the commerce district. Foreign traders who try to circumvent these regulations are quickly deported without a chance to explain themselves. Outsiders are only allowed to trade with merchants specifically appointed by the Order.</p>\n<p>The Order expects all visitors to show reverence to the Martyr. Priests await new arrivals in the chapels of the spaceports, to instruct them in the proper rites and prayers. Talismans belonging to other Icons are allowed, but every prayer needs to be finished with an uttering to the Martyr.</p>\n<h2>THE MAGISTRATES</h2>\n<p>The most apparent manifestation of Order rule in the city comes in the form of the Magistrates. The Magistrates are all biosculpted to look identical, with perfect androgynous features that would be appealing were it not for their completely emotionless expressions. Persistent rumors maintain that Magistrates have been seen outside of Zalos in the pursuit of heretics.</p>\n<h3>✺ SAJEEN</h3>\n<p>A Sajeen is kept in a tiny, inconspicuous cylinder and is usually worn by Magistrates in a necklace. During interrogations, the cylinder extends into dozens of tiny tentacles that penetrate the face of a subject and connects them to the mind of the Magistrate. No one besides the animatheurges know exactly how The Sajeen works, only that it forces its victim to share their most intimate secrets. The Sajeen leaves no trace barring some light bruising - but some say that the interrogation sometimes renders its victim as a broken shadow of their former self.</p>\n<h2>THE DOMES</h2>\n<p>The three largest domes house the commerce district, the Souk of Mists, and the monastery quarters with its magnificent temples and military installations. The prayer bells located here reverberate all across the city and call the faithful and visitors to prayer. Showing reverence to the Icons several times a day is a condition for staying on Karrmerruk.</p>\n<p>The fourth dome was destroyed by suicide bombers with apparent connections to the heretics on Zahedan. Some think that it’s odd that these terrorists targeted the residential district instead of the monastery quarter or the commercial district, which would have had a greater effect on the relations with the rest of the Horizon.</p>\n<p>The fifth and sixth domes house the gardens of Assir and the 11th Ossuary.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"y6duw45NRsJtCmRT","name":"04 - Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CONFLICTS</h1>\n<h2>THE ZAHEDAN HERESY</h2>\n<p>The biggest and the most present conflict in the system is the civil war on Zahedan. According to the Order of the Pariah, a huge portion of the planet’s population has succumbed to the heresy of false prophets. It’s no secret that The Order worships the Martyr, an aspect of the Judge, and that they see all other Icons as mere shadows – false manifestations and fragments of the Martyr.</p>\n<p>The heretics zon Zahedan have left the embrace of the Martyr and taken up arms against their former brethren. They claim the Martyr is a false Icon, a deceiver and liar who’s enslaving the minds and souls of the Zalosian people. Instead of the fanatical worship of the Martyr, they advocate diversified faith and religious free-thinking.</p>\n<p>At first, The Order reacted by eliminating the selfproclaimed prophets who preached this madness – convinced they could end the heresy with purifying fire. But these measures had the opposite effect. New prophets emerged among the population, and what had started as a minor heresy suddenly escalated into an open rebellion.</p>\n<p>The war has affected all of Zahedan, encompassing everything from smaller guerrilla skirmishes to full-scale annexations of cities and other strategic locations. The Order has spent tremendous amounts of birr and resources to crush the rebellion, but so far has failed to do so.</p>\n<p>One reason for this failure is that the rebels employ a decentralized leadership structure. Groups of armed rebels can pop up anywhere, led by local priests and prophets. Whenever one cell is struck down, two more seem to take its place. Furthermore, not all cells cooperate with each other, making a predictive military response difficult.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, both sides have access to advanced antimatter weapons, Golim armor, and bionics never seen beyond the borders of Zalos. Were it not for the blockade of The Martyr Fleet around Zahedan, the rebellion would have surely spread to the rest of the system. The biggest fear of the Martyr Council is that the heresy will gain a foothold on Zalos. This would bring the war to the heart of the system, disrupt logistics, and hamper recruitment.</p>\n<h2>DISSENT IN THE COUNCIL</h2>\n<p>There are also disputes within The Order itself regarding the true teachings of the Martyr and how they should be interpreted. In heated debates, rabid priests argue the meaning of the old prophecies and how to deal with the heretics on Zahedan. However, this never leads to open conflict, as all Council members agree that the moment is at hand when the Darkness will return to the Third Horizon.The Council members know they simply cannot afford to stand divided in the face of the impending end times.</p>\n<p>The Council also agrees that the lockdown of Zalos must continue. They don’t think the rest of the Horizon is ready to see the truth of what is to come, and they prefer to keep prying eyes at bay.</p>\n<h2>DISRUPTED TRADE</h2>\n<p>Trade with Zalos has become significantly harder due to the lockdown. Demand is skyrocketing for Zalos’ natural resources – especially mineral oil and gas – and competition is fierce. It would have been easy to sign exclusive agreements with the Consortium, but the Council is reluctant to let any individual faction dominate Zalosian trade.</p>\n<p>This has opened up a market for free traders and other, smaller market players. The ever-watchful Martyr Fleet has ensured competition between players has not yet devolved into conflict. But it’s only a matter of time before a hottempered merchant lord decides to seize a larger market share by knocking off all rivals.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
