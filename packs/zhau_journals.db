{"_id":"7qtKj32beJFNfs5J","name":"03 - Locations in the Zhau System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE ZHAU SYSTEM</h1>\n<h2>Z-3</h2>\n<p>Z-3 is dominated by a supercontinent that stretches across its two hemispheres. The land mass consists of steep cliffs, deep ravines, and desert landscapes – all surrounded by a globe-spanning ocean. The coastlines are fertile, with regular downpours and a flourishing ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The planet is home to Mharatta, the Honor Legion’s shipyard, located in the mineral-rich northern archipelago.</p>\n<h2>Z-9</h2>\n<p>Z-9 features three vast continents divided by a large acidic ocean. The coastlines feature ragged cliffs slowly succumbing to the ocean, while the land masses are covered by vast forests, large mountain ranges, and windswept plains.</p>\n<p>Akenatohna, the largest spaceport on the planet, is located in the halo-shaped continent circling the equator of the planet, the Teje Plateau. Some say that it is just a matter of time before the metal-rich continent sinks into the acidic ocean, but its inhabitants are convinced that it could take centuries.</p>\n<p>The planet is infamous for the large number of fortune seekers and settlers who have lost their lives to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and fickle weather conditions.</p>\n<h2>Z-12</h2>\n<p>Z-12 is one of the many moons circling Z-9. The moon recently became a hotbed for conflict due to the discovery of Thorium Crystal fields. The Honor Legion were quick to distribute claims to the fields, but somehow, someone has managed to distribute counterfeit resource claims through the Lance Station extranet. So far, Claims Office administrators have been unable to tell legitimate and counterfeit claims apart, and armed prospectors have come to blows over ownership of the highly coveted crystal fields. The Honor Legion has sent patrol ships to the moon to keep the peace, but it is just a matter of time before hostilities erupt.</p>\n<h2>Z-29</h2>\n<p>Z-29 is a lush tropical planet characterized by thousands of small archipelagos covering a giant ocean. Many settlers have tried to colonize the planet only to find that it is not suitable for permanent habitation. The planet suffers from frequent storms and tsunamis capable of sweeping away entire colonies.</p>\n<p>Still, colonists, biologists and archaeologists are attracted to the planet. The ocean contains a rich ecosystem and precious underwater crystals that can be harvested from the seabed that are highly prized by jewelers. Archaeologists are also interested in the peculiar stone formations found on the planet, believed to be remnants of the Portal Builder civilization.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"F8tuNSvdUi712BDP","name":"04 - Lance Station","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LANCE STATION</h1>\n<p>Lance Station is a heavily armed portal station that controls all traffic going in and out of the Zhau system. Ikram Hassan’s mutineers in the Honor Legion recently took over the portal station, equipped it with enough firepower to make anyone think twice about trying to reclaim it, and set up a free trading zone that has become the Zhau system’s primary marketplace. The Honor Legion takes a percentage of each trade and enjoys a good life as the system’s belligerent dictators and defence force.</p>\n<p>The station’s security is assured by two important assets. The first is the Almas Circlet, a sophisticated sensor network that alerts the stronghold whenever something emerges from the portal fields. The second is the ex-Legion battleship Anabasis, the flagship of the Honor Fleet, which is often anchored in the shadow of Lance Station, ready to defend it.</p>\n<p>The emergence and rapid growth of the station’s marketplace is a development that no one expected. Its success has been buoyed by what is known as the “Honor Effect.” The Honor Effect, practiced by traders and pirates throughout the Zhau system, is a euphemism for forcibly seizing control of large quantities of mixed, unrefined raw materials from a rival and then reselling them – typically, still unprocessed – at below-market value. As long as The Honor Legion receives a percentage of each transaction, it is willing to turn a blind eye to the origins of goods being traded.</p>\n<p>The station is also home to the Claims Office, where prospectors can register their strikes in the Zhau system and receive the protection of The Honor Legion – again, provided they hand over a percentage of the earnings from their claims. This arrangement has prompted prospectors to give the office an unofficial moniker: The Office of Bribes.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"SKWZoEQjmiKdxLPD","name":"02 - The Zhau System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE ZHAU SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>Zhau is a trinary star system so sparsely populated that it rarely confers names on its celestial bodies. Instead, the names of celestial bodies are based on the position of the object relative to the system’s star.</p>\n<p>At first glance, several of the planets in the Zhau system seem to be prime candidates for human habitation. However, several of them have turned out to be highly unstable and prone to extensive natural disasters. In the wake of these catastrophes, worn settlers have found traces of the Portal Builder civilization – a discovery that has spurred a second wave of colonizers coming from all corners of the Horizon.</p>\n<p>The worlds orbiting Zhau-B are undergoing rapid growth with a multitude of new colonies. All of these colonies are formally under the protection of the Honor Legion, but also owe allegiance to the Carbon Sultanate of Zorana.</p>\n<p>The distant Zhau-C star is shrouded in mystery, and is often used by parents of the Quadrant to frighten their children. Of the many expeditions that have travelled there, few have returned – but those that do speak of marvelous things. The wildest rumours speak of hidden portals to other worlds in the Third Horizon or beyond. It is well known that the Foundation was planning an expedition to Zhau-C that had to be put on hold due to the power struggles in the system.</p>\n<h2>REMNANTS OF THE PORTAL BUILDERS</h2>\n<p>Explorers have recently found several ancient artifacts and temple-like constructions in the Zhau system. Many believe that these are Portal Builder in origin, and a few scientists go so far as to claim that the abundance of habitable planets in the system indicates that this once was a core system of the Portal Builder civilization. These discoveries have turned the system into a ripe target for archaeologists and looters.</p>\n<h2>THE HONOR LEGION</h2>\n<p>No one knows how such a tightly-reined faction such as the Legion could devolve into open mutiny, but it is said to have begun with Admiral Ikram Hassan storming off after a disagreement with the Legion’s supreme leader, Suhaima Taslim. The Admiral’s flotilla deviated from its assigned mission to provide military escort for Consortium bulk carriers only to turn up in the Zhau system a week later, aiming it’s thermonuclear warheads upon the portal stations and declaring themselves Akbar. The Alabaster council and the Janhagir nomads were quick to recognise the sovereignty of their new neighbors, and thus the rogue state of Zhau was born.</p>\n<p>Breaking away from the Legion does not seem to have had an effect on the spirits of the former Legionaries at all. They enjoy their new role as the governors of the Zhau system and put great confidence in their leader, Ikram Hassan – a man who rules over the flotilla much like how a patriarch rules a family.</p>\n<p>The Honor Legion recently initiated an extensive recruitment campaign among the system’s colonies, and has built a small shipyard on Zhau-3. Their growing flotilla still cannot compete with the armadas of the factions, nor keep up with the Janhagir Fleet or the corsair fleets of the Alabaster Council. Still, with the strategic placement and heavy armaments of Lance Station, coupled with the thermonuclear capabilities of the Anabasis, the Honor Fleet can inflict massive damage on an invading fleet.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE HONOR FLEET</h3>\n<p>The fleet is the backbone of the Honor Legion, but also it’s achilles heel. Gaining control of the flagship Anabasis was seen as a welcome gift from the Icons, but it also diminished the importance of the ground forces and the diplomatic corps. The threat of thermonuclear destruction has been dubbed ‘The Anabasis Doctrine’, and has been able to resolve many long-standing disputes without having to put boots on the ground, much to the dismay of Colonel Eubabba Ibismal.</p>\n<p>While there is no exact information on the true size of the Honor Fleet, the admirals office has started to suspect that several of the factions active in the Quadrant have sent infiltrators to the Legion’s recruitment campaign.</p>\n<h2>SETTLERS AND PROSPECTORS</h2>\n<p>Each of Zhau’s three stars have habitable worlds that have seen an influx of new colonists thanks to the corsair pacification efforts of the Honor Legion. The newcomers come from all corners of the Horizon and range from refugees looking for a safe haven to prospectors looking to strike big. Few manage to survive the harsh realities of the system.</p>\n<p>The price for colonization is high. The Honor Fleet demands tribute for its protection, and if the tithe cannot be paid in birr or commodities, the Legion commanders happily accept payment in new recruits or outright slavery. It is strictly forbidden to establish so-called “shadow colonies” in the system, and any illegal intrusions are swiftly dealt with to prevent others from trying.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

Now, headed by their wellarmed flotilla and the battleship Anabasis, the Honor Legion has taken the role of system governors.</p>\n<p>Since their take-over, the market for colonization and mineral claims has been busted open; anyone can buy a claim in the Zhau system for a set percentage of their yearly yield.
