{"_id":"2mM08ZOwUwIGtoXu","name":"01 - Home of the Dars","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>HOME OF THE DARS</h1>\n<p>Dabaran is ruled by a flourishing class of nobles living in oasis gardens, domed palaces and ravine seraglios. The Dars are embroiled in a constant struggle to surpass one another in arts, crafts, sciences and wealth. This race for perfection takes a variety of forms, from creating intricate mosaics and palaces to shining, mechanical nightingales and owls.</p>\n<p>Dabaran was spared from the worst horrors of the Portal Wars. The planet was not subject to any major bombardments, and the Dars had no fleets with which to engage in the fighting. Efforts were made instead to secure the planet’s self-sustainability; by fortifying the oasis domes and stopping the spread of the contagious hatred and suspicion that swept the rest of the Horizon. In Lotus, the temple city, alliances and marriages were formed to safeguard the fragile peace and to further progress and enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The planet Dabaran is a world of contrasts with fertile and warm lowlands, and cold, almost sterile, stony desert highlands. Spread out across both high- and lowlands are several cities, oasis domes and other settlements.</p>\n<p>On Dabaran, day and night can see temperature differences of up to 60 degrees Celsius. Summers are hot with high temperatures and winters the complete opposite. Exterior farms are dependent on climate-resistant plants, or the use of domes. The highlands suffer the most from extreme temperatures, although the extremes have started to stabilize in recent years due to the greenhouse gases introduced to the atmosphere by the Dars’ climate reactors. Despite the thinner atmosphere in the highlands, humans can breathe without the aid of equipment, though the use of dust filters and masks can be helpful.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the lowlands have more stable temperatures, allowing for open palaces, cities and farms. Air pressure is also higher and it is easier to breathe than in the highlands. The larger cities are also found here, along with the planet’s only large body of water – the Sea of Bahri.</p>\n<h3>✺ DARS AND DARI</h3>\n<p>Regardless of whether they are emirs, feriks, pashas or sultans, nobles should be addressed using the royal prefix ”Dar” or ”Dari”, and the same term is used when speaking of their emirates.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"933qgjde3vbPy0li","name":"04 - People and Culture","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h1>\n<h2>DABARAN TRANQUILITY</h2>\n<p>The Dabarans are a calm and thoughtful people. It is not a coincidence that the Seeker’s Circle has its largest presence in the Third Horizon on Dabaran. For a while, the Circle aspired to become a faction of their own, who could have spoken for Dabaran in the Council of Factions on Coriolis. The idea collapsed when the Church of the Icons assimilated large parts of the sect. Dabaran now operates through the Church, or stays out of interplanetary politics altogether. As long as the bulk freighters keep arriving from Mira or Kua, no one is concerned.</p>\n<p>Dabaran tranquility is also mirrored in daily life, at least for the privileged. Arts, mathematics, mechanical creations and philosophy are all highly valued. Akhdirai, the craft of sculpting trees and bushes into beautiful works of art using only a knife, is practiced in the oasis domes.</p>\n<p>For the servants, who are often confined to slave-like conditions in primitive barracks or underground lodgings, life is instead a calm pursuit of succeeding in one’s profession, reaching perfection in service. According to Dabaran philosophy, this will lead to the highest form of self-fulfillment. Critical voices are being raised, however, saying that living conditions in the servant cities are far from acceptable.</p>\n<h2>MATHEMATICS</h2>\n<p>Just as arts and crafts are valued on Dabaran, so too are mathematicians and philosophers held in high regard. Solving theorems – and especially getting one named after yourself, is extremely desirable. Even common people spend their free time with mathematical puzzles, and math clubs are a common sight in the qahwa-cafés of the cities. It is said that Emira Yousina Kelouti went into a deep torpor trying to solve Yang-Mirhouris theory about elemental particles. Her now comatose body is supposedly cared for by her faithful servants in the Dusk Palace on the outskirts of Dar Bahri.</p>\n<p>For the superstitious people, there are mathemantics who use numerology and algebraic formulas to predict the future. Said mathemantics can be found on almost every corner of the Dar Bahri bazaars, providing visitors with a formula for future happiness for just a few birr.</p>\n<h2>DABARAN ALCHEMY</h2>\n<p>Closely related to mathematics is the chemical algebra, or alchemy as it is commonly known. Substances, elemental particles and light are combined with mathematical precision, creating elixirs, drugs and pharmaceuticals that are used for everything from aching joints to treating unrequited love and blind rage. The larger Consortium corporations are always on the lookout for new pharmaceuticals to market across the Third Horizon, even if most of them don’t have any significant effect - at least according to the Foundation’s biochemists. The Dabarans themselves simply shrug off such accusations, as Djinni, alchemy, and supernatural phenomena are commonplace on the planet.</p>\n<h2>FAIRY TALES</h2>\n<p>One artform that doesn’t require more than a sharp tongue is storytelling. Every emir, sultan or high merchant makes sure to have their own storyteller who can retell the fairy tales and stories of Dabaran. This is usually done in verse or in regular speech. The most famous tales are the one hundred written down by the concubine Shahrazad, the favorite storyteller of Sheikh Hagramenon.</p>\n<p>In addition to the performance artists at the courts, there are also the nomadic storytellers known as ‘tarrab’, who travel across Dabaran with the giant desert caravans. Every year, thousands of tarrab convene at Dar Bahri for the annual Shahrazad festival, to swap and weave tales from every corner of their desert home.</p>\n<p>Lately, mocking tales of the Zenithians have become more and more popular. They are often short in nature and retell how Consortium merchants, Foundation scientists or Hegemony nobles are ridiculed or tricked by the faithful, dabarans or mischievous Djinni. </p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"CSnqEcETzlNJCBlV","name":"08 - Dar Bhari","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>DAR BAHRI</h1>\n<p>On the shores of the Bahri Sea lies the lowland metropolis Dar Bahri, the unofficial hub of Dabaran. Here, emirs, sultans and sultanas meet to converse, establish connections and solve disputes in the sunlit beach pavilions raised by emir Dar-Rahmalan. These beautiful surroundings suit the planet’s rulers better than the narrow alleys of Lotus, where it is only possible to travel by foot or by palanquin.</p>\n<p>The city spreads out above the beach arcade, with its pristine white bricked villas and palaces dotting the hills leading up to a giant mountain range. Towards the outskirts of the city, small, meandering residential areas replace the luxurious estates. On the far side of the mountain lies the spaceport and Dar Bahris servant city.</p>\n<p>The city center is crowded with twisting sky towers, where the large Dabaran trade houses, the emir corporations and the Great Emirate Bank have their offices. The Colonial Agency also has a presence here, as well as such Consortium corporations as Parr and Exeter. The Sadaal State Corporations, Miran tradehouses and other foreign commercial businesses all share headquarters in a giant sky tower known as the Friendspire.</p>\n<h2>LAW OF THE LATIFA</h2>\n<p>The planetary police corps known as the Latifa are responsible for law and order in Dar Bahri. Their officers patrol the city in fast gravcraft equipped with technological instruments that rival some of the factions. The Latifa spend a significant portion of their time monitoring the Firstcome immigrants who make up the majority of Dar Bahris servant city.</p>\n<h2>RAHMALAN’S COUNCIL</h2>\n<p>Dar Bahri is ruled by Emir Dar-Rahmalan the Elder and his daughters Dari-Jahra, Mefti, and Masedleh. Assisting them is a well-oiled bureaucracy of advisors and consultants. Rahmalan’s council also features an ever-changing assortment of sponsors whose admittance depends on their investments in the city. The current sponsors are the Grand Emirates Bank, the Colonial Agency, Parr, the Shariqah emirate, Dar Bouti and Yimary Prospect of Sadaal.</p>\n<h2>THE HAND OF THE LION</h2>\n<p>The Hand of the Lion is a new, albeit unofficial, authority in the city, made up of a union of workers and servants who toil in the city’s palaces and businesses. It is said that they are supported by the Free League, the secretive eunuch rebels as well as agitators from the Conglomerate on Kua. So far they’ve only acted against smaller households with a record of servant mistreatment, but recent rumors have it that the Lotus Council is about to grant the union free reign of Dar Bahris servant city, essentially turning it into a selfgoverned, autonomous enclave. This has caused quite a stir among the Emir’s men, who have ordered the Latifa and a cell of Consortium agents to root out the identities of the secretive union leaders.</p>\n<h2>CAPITAL OF FINE CULTURE</h2>\n<p>Dar Bahri has always been considered to be the nexus of fine culture on Dabaran, but in recent years this has turned into luxurious extravagance and decadence. The beach promenade teems with art boutiques and emporia that produce everything from sculptures to jewelry and calligraphic art. The Micrographs are a particularly successful guild of artisans, who utilize pristine magnifying technology to etch microscopic works of art into jewelry, tabulas and tags.</p>\n<p>Fashion designers are held in high regard, with tailors such as Abbas Soura and Mitema Miroux attracting crowds from all over the Horizon for their collections of palatial attire, bejewelled gallabeyas and embroidered kaftans.</p>\n<h2>THE SACRED GEOMETRY</h2>\n<p>Mathematics and geometrics has had a huge influence on the architecture and infrastructure of Dar Bahri, even though recent construction projects have broken up some of the symmetry. Each district is built in the shape of a basic geometric shape and the blocks are sectioned according to old algebraic number sequences. The city planner and architect Noussana Balbis-Lakhmi, who laid the groundwork for the city, is said to have hidden geometric symbolism in each district of the city. Some people believe that finding these secret focal points will unlock the mysteries of the Icons, provide clues about the end of all time, or the location of valuable treasure. Many an adventurer, mathematician, and prophet has tried, but none has succeeded.</p>\n<h2>THE BEACH ARCADE</h2>\n<p>In the middle of Dar Bahri lies the famous Beach Arcade, a long boulevard along the lake’s beach that consists of smooth stones and golden sand shipped in from the moon N’Youma. Every day, the rich and their servants gather to enjoy tarrab storytellers, acrobatic shows, freshly grilled shish-kebab, roasted almonds and freshly cut fruit under the glow of the red sun. The piers are packed with yachts, luxury hovercraft, and floating palaces belonging to the rich and famous - each trying to outdo their neighbour in terms of scale, luxury, or decorations.</p>\n<h2>THE SILVER DISTRICT</h2>\n<p>The brand new Silver District occupies what once was a residential area. Beautiful, geometrically shaped buildings house Dabaran’s bionic corporations, as well as some of the larger corporations from other systems, such as CelerDelekta and Omicron. Scores of scientists dressed in white move between the different biofactories and headquarters, along streets covered by giant sun sails. At the center of the district there is a monument dedicated to the famous bionicist Gerodes Afrat, the creator of the Padshah children – bionic humanites that never reach adulthood and who gains the intellect of a savant by the age of six.</p>\n<h2>THE GREAT BAZAAR</h2>\n<p>The great bazaar of Dar Bahri is split in two: The old section is a labyrinthine mess of alleyways, tiny squares, and souks filled with loud peddlers, street performers, and mathemantics. Visitors have to stay alert for hustlers, monkeys trained for pick-pocketing, and the members of the Simbaldin syndicate – the only criminal network operating in Dar Bahri.</p>\n<p>In the new section, one instead finds well-planned, straight arcades, with large, spacious halls decorated with elaborate mosaics and shaded by flowing sun sails. Here are the emporia, luxury stores, tailors and boutiques run by famous names such as Metris, Yousifa Khan and Mashadeh, as well as larger brands owned by the Consortium. The new section is guarded by a score of corporate guard companies, as well as sporadic Latifa-patrols.</p>\n<h3>✺ NIGHTINGALES AND SHAH</h3>\n<p>The Dabarans are renowned for their fine crafts, such as Metris’ hand-built luxury vehicles, Il-Aahl’s beautiful clothing and the clockmaker Ingios Gharbigah’s mechanical nightingales. The nightingales are minutely created with clockwork mechanisms and feather ribbons and are often given as luxurious gifts. The Dabaran shah is a complex variant of the regular game and the boards are artworks in and of themselves, with patterns and looks of the interior of small domed oases.</p>\n<h2>THE OCTAGON DISTRICT</h2>\n<p>The small temple district of Dar Bahri is known as the Octagon District - or simply ‘The Octagon’, due to its shape. The streets are lined up in such a way that they create an enormous enneagram that venerates the Faceless One without providing a specific temple. In the central square, prophets, preachers, and the faithful gather to pray and preach about the glory of the Icons. The square is considered to be one of the mathematical focal points of Noussana Balbis-Lakhmi, and several attempts have been made to dig through the square’s centre to find whatever treasure might be lying underneath.</p>\n<h2>THE PALACES</h2>\n<p>Nestled between the radiant Beach Arcade and the tranquility of the sacred olive groves lies the majority of the city’s luxury homes and palaces. Here live the rich bureaucrats, visiting faction representatives, and several Dars. The estates all have a spectacular view of the city and the sea. Space is scarce, and as a result, some of the larger palaces are suspended on top of grav generators, slowly turning to always face the light from the red sun. This often leads to quarrels, as some of the floating buildings cast their shadow over a less affluent neighbor’s sun deck, balcony or pool.</p>\n<p>Roads in this area are narrow and are only traversable on foot or by light hovercraft. This emphasizes the aristocratic flair of the area and reinforces the gap between the classes, since it requires a host of servants to take care of the household’s purchases and services.</p>\n<h2>THE SACRED OLIVE GROVES</h2>\n<p>On the slopes above the city lie the sacred olive groves that have been consecrated to the city’s rulers and to the Icons. At the center of the groves lies an ornate crypt that has been described as one of the city’s nine mathematical focal points. On some nights, foolish tomb robbers attempt to break into the tombs’ necrosarium. The Latifa have a number of surveillance drones, similar to those on Coriolis, patrolling the olive groves for this very reason.</p>\n<p>Safrahs, a sub-species of Djinni, supposedly live among the groves, constantly pranking visitors who bring offerings to the entombed emirs, and to the monument of the Traveller - the icon protecting the groves.</p>\n<h2>THE SPACEPORT AND THE SERVANT CITY</h2>\n<p>Behind the mountain along which Dar Bahri is built and out towards the desert lies the large spaceport. The port has innumerable hangars, landing strips, ship platforms, and smaller shipyards for repairs and ship services. Shuttles and small freighters dart through the air day and night.</p>\n<p>Endless rows of prefabricated habitation blocks stretch next to the spaceport, housing most of the city’s workers and servants. The habitation blocks used to be white, but have turned a dusty grey over time in the dust clouds whipped up by innumerable freighters, luxury liners, and cargo haulers departing the spaceport. Washing lines and improvised electrical wiring hang over alleys where children play under the supervision of grandparents who are too old or too ill to work on the plantations or in the palaces. The hover cars of the Latifa patrol the servant city day and night, not bothering to avoid sonic booms over the sleeping servant population.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE SCORPION OF SARKAND</h3>\n<p>Nights in the Servant City are far from harmless. The thugs of the Simbaldin Syndicate have laid claim to the territory and have opened opor dens, fight clubs and a red light district. Unemployed servants, who are supposed to be deported, sometimes rob servants returning home from the palaces at night. Lately, someone has started to fight the degeneration of the district. A veiled avenger in a battle exo emblazoned with the scorpion tail insignia of the Sarkand Janissaries has been seen striking against all sorts of criminals and syndicate holdings.</p>\n<h2>THE SAIL PALACE</h2>\n<p>The Sail Palace is one of the Horizon’s eight wonders, built in the highland desert outside of Dar Bahri. The palace is a tall sky tower with many terraces, masts and pinnacles. Every day, gigantic sails are raised on the terraces to slowly rotate the tower in the desert winds. The white sails were replaced by black ones for an entire cycle to commemorate the passing of great Dar Sakam Bahri, and the tower now also houses the Dars’ mausoleum.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"FJTC2rBZ4QFShDTf","name":"02 - Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CONFLICTS</h1>\n<p>To the outside observer, Dabaran appears to be calm like a desert oasis – but underneath its serene surface the planet seethes with conflicts that not even the treaties of Lotus can keep in check. They rarely break out into the open, the notable exceptions being the water wars and the occasional riots in the servant cities.</p>\n<h2>THE WATER WARS</h2>\n<p>Peace has reigned on Dabaran since long before the Portal Wars, but large emirates and noble houses have begun competing for the most important commodity on the planet - water. This vital resource is common in the lowlands along the equator where underground springs and rivers abound. But in the highlands, where several nobles have their oasis domes, one must drill for water, and a market for drilling rights has sprung up. Water rights are usually secured with birr or by intermarriage. The expansion of oasis domes in the last few years has led to physical confrontations to secure pumping stations and water pipelines.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE EVADIRES CONFLICT</h3>\n<p>The countess Dari Evadires has long laid claim to a large water deposit in the northern stone desert. Her three oasis domes flourish, while surrounding domes have begun to dry up. As a consequence, the surrounding emirates, supported by sultan Dar Bouti, have hired a small army of free companies to seize Evadires’ pumping stations. Dari Evadires however, has the assistance of an external benefactor and has secretly gained access to advanced defense systems, mercenaries and even the latest faction technology. The conflict has already left two oasis domes in ruins and threatens to spread to the lowlands.</p>\n<h2>THE PENTA-EMIRATE</h2>\n<p>The Penta-Emirate is located in the domed highland valley of Samkra, one of the most fertile regions of the highlands, with an abundance of rich water deposits and underground lakes. The grand emirate consists of five smaller emirates: Dar Bahrey, Dar Sassana, Dar Dabai, Dar Muscat and Dar YasAl-Bu, who have joined forces and renounced Dari society with a declaration of secession.</p>\n<p>The Penta-Emirate is ruled by the matriarch Liwa AhSassana and the Council of Five. With their secession, they have managed to circumvent ancient laws and traditions regulating banking and investments on Dabaran. The Emirate has created the Grand Emirate Bank that acts as a large funding agency for expeditions and organisations, and are said to be on the verge of requesting entry into the Consortium. Rumors regarding money laundering and the financing of rebels in the neighboring Uharu system have been the main obstacles for full membership status so far. It is said that the rebels have established a training camp in the Samkra Valley under the surveillance of the Consortium’s Special Section.</p>\n<h2>ZENITHIAN ARROGANCE</h2>\n<p>The Consortium, spearheaded by the Parr corporation and the Colonial Agency, has started to take an interest in the rich soil of the lowlands. With permission from Emir Karabah of Lotus, several multi-farms have been established on the slopes of the Yeva Valley. Pumping stations and colossal crawlers are slowly taking over the valley and are responsible for the massive dust storms sweeping out towards the neighboring Dars. Perfidious rumors have it that the Zenithians are attempting to drill their way into the Wound which is located just north of the Yeva Valley – why else would they have mobilized Parr-Nestera's attack brigades?</p>\n<h2>THE SERVANT RIOTS</h2>\n<p>In the last few years, as more and more workers arrive on the planet to work as servants and farmers, a large number of ‘servant cities’ have sprung up around the larger emirates and oasis domes. These ‘servant cities’ are mostly small ghettos of prefabricated houses stacked on top of each other. Their inhabitants travel to the magnificent manors and lush fields in the day and are shuttled back in the evening. Conditions in the servant cities vary and are often plagued by contaminated water and bad sanitation. This has led to several riots, all of which have been shut down by the Latifa - Dabarans planetary police force.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE EUNUCH UPRISING</h3>\n<p>Emir Suleimei Phalx-Cousou was known across the Third Horizon for his enormous palace, the Diamond Hyacinth, which was said to hold more than 1001 rooms and an equal number of fountains. In his harem, he had over a hundred concubines of all genders, guarded by enslaved eunuchs - often his own sons. The eunuchs’ lives were meagre, consisting mostly of rules and punishments.</p>\n<p>According to legend, Parifes, the oldest eunuch, entered into an agreement with the desert Djinn Mafrat on a dark night. He promised to obey its commands for 200 years in exchange for the freedom of his brothers. The next day, the emir and his concubines turned to stone and the eunuchs were free to leave the palace and wander out into the desert. Today, no one knows where the palace lies, but many treasure hunters have braved the northern deserts to find it.</p>\n<p>Since then, the eunuchs have worked in the shadows to stop injustices on Dabaran - perhaps as part of the Djinn’s command. They have been known to show up in palaces and holdings where servants are treated badly, and are said to be responsible for the massacre of the Khema family in their oasis dome.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"PmzfHb6a4YRkXUaS","name":"07 - Cities of Dabaran","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CITIES OF DABARAN</h1>\n<h2>LOTUS, THE TEMPLE CITY</h2>\n<p>To the Dars of Dabaran, Lotus is the religious capital. It lies on Mount Loti in the golden Taraa mountain range, just west of the mysterious Wound – a wide chasm whose volcanic depths have yet to be explored.</p>\n<p>The city has existed as long as there have been written records on Dabaran, and several temples and chapels are cut directly into the yellow sandstone of the mountain. In the great temple, covered by the Dome of the Icons, the Lotus Council convenes. Pilgrims from all over the Horizon gather on the square outside of the temple, having walked all the way from the space port of Bas Ghoura, since no spacecraft, hovercraft or motor vehicles are allowed in the narrow alleys of the city.</p>\n<p>Holy artefacts, sacrificial gifts and stones falsely marketed as bricks from the Dome of the Icons are sold to the pilgrims in the Prophet’s Bazaar. Order in the bazaar, as in the rest of the city, is kept by battle preachers belonging to the Order of Quar, who patrol and preach all over the city.</p>\n<p>The city is ruled by the Lotus Council, made up by matriarchs from the Lotus Sisters, preachers and prophets. The council provides advice on religious and moral matters, and has been a source of enlightenment to the Dars of Dabaran for more than 150 years.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE LOTUS SISTERS</h3>\n<p>The Lotus Sisters is a sisterhood of female philosophers and prophets who have taken it upon themselves to spread the truth of the Icons to the Third Horizon. The sisterhood used to be a part of the Circle of Seekers until differences of opinion forced the two groups to split. As a result, they are now opposed by the Church of the Icons. The sisters fill a similar role to the Samaritans on Coriolis: they run hospitals, almshouses and free schools in servant cities all over Dabaran. Some say that the matriarchs of the sisterhood are in close contact with the Draconites, and that they have discovered a way to alleviate the so-called Mystic’s disease.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE WOUND</h3>\n<p>The Wound is said to be of Portal Builder origin, but there have never been any artifact discoveries in the area that could prove it. Several expeditions have disappeared into the darkness of the Wound without a trace. To settle the matter once and for all, the Foundation recently sent a team of xeno-archaeologists to the site, protected by a Parr-Nestera mercenary company called the Tomb Reavers.</p>\n<h3>✺ OWL OF MINERVA</h3>\n<p>In addition to the famous temples, prophets and preachers, the Temple City also houses Amira’s Mechanica and Wonders - a fine mechanist workshop. Artisans and pilgrims travel here to gaze upon the mechanical owl created by the mechanurg Minerva before she was tragically lost to the Mystics’ Disease. The owl is a true wonder, made of bronze and copper-colored gears, pistons and other mechanical parts. The creation is so fantastic that it has been possessed by a Djinn known as Emrut, who dispenses advice, performs pranks, and tricks the visitors of the workshop on a daily basis.</p>\n<h2>CLOUD CITY</h2>\n<p>The Shariqah emirate is quite different from Dabaran’s other Dars. Instead of living inside a domed oasis, Emir Yossipa Dari Shariqah has created a floating home - Cloud City. The city circles above the equator on an elliptic base covered with multiple oasis domes. The city has become a center for gambling and is visited both by the privileged of Dabaran and from the rest of the Horizon. There are always grav races, shah tournaments, and other events taking place here. This affluent wealth has attracted the Syndicate, who operate in the city through secret envoys.</p>\n<h2>THE TUNNEL CITY</h2>\n<p>Dabaran’s south pole contains a large, natural cavern complex filled with lakes, rivers and large aquifers. Here, the prophet and oracle Lysca founded a temple several hundred years ago. Since then, Portal Builder artifacts have been found in the part of the complex now called Amada’s Arcade. How they got there is unknown, but there are theories that the cave system is connected to the Wound.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, the temple has been expanded to accommodate hundreds of preachers, pilgrims and seekers, as well as xeno-archaeologists, explorers and grave robbers. Entrepreneurs have opened cantinas, equipment emporiums and taverns in the caves. Around fifty cycles ago, the temple’s prophets declared the caves a Sanctuary to Lysca and it is now commonly known as the Tunnel City. A small, private space seraglio on the surface can accommodate small freighters and shuttles as well as caravans crossing over the highlands.</p>\n<h2>THE MATHEMATICAL INSTITUTE OF DADDAH</h2>\n<p>In the city of Daddah lies one of Dabarans pearls, the great university. It is here that the sons and daughters of the planet’s emirs and Dars travel to receive higher education. The school is a city in itself, with institutions covering everything from the sciences, such as astronics and geochemistry, to fine mechanics and poetry.</p>\n<p>Most famous of all the scientific branches is FermalGaroud’s mathematical institute, headed by professors Fermal and Aria Jahin. Here they perform pure mathematical research and its theoretical application. A controversy has arisen in the last few cycles between professor Fermal and the Foundation, about which is the last of the so-called Icon Prime Numbers: 257 as calculated on Dabaran, or 65 537 as determined by the Foundation’s semi-intelligence Lahhal.</p>\n<p> </p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"iJsubuqMjuE6mpat","name":"05 - Travel on Dabaran","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>TRAVEL ON DABARAN</h1>\n<p>The means of travel on Dabaran depends on your station. Myriads of beautiful shuttles whizz back and forth between the larger oasis domes and the lowland cities as the privileged travel to their estates. Shuttles are also used for transport into space. There are only a few space ports on Dabaran, usually located well away from the palaces and the wealthy city centers.</p>\n<p>The servants of Dabaran usually travel in cumbersome freight shuttles or ground-based caravans. In the cities, servants utilize a hovercraft service known as Dolmush to quickly move between the servant cities and the palaces of their masters.</p>\n<p>The most exalted Dars often travel in extravagant caravans. These usually consist of luxurious gravcraft, rebuilt into small, floating palaces, accompanied by large entourages of courtesans and servants mounted on Algolan elephants and Miran purebreeds. In the highlands it is more common to travel in large ground crawlers surrounded by a fleet of smaller vehicles, like ants surrounding a termite queen.</p>\n<p>Some Dars of the larger lowland cities pride themselves in their beautiful, wheeled personal vehicles, whose roofs and sides can turn transparent at the driver's discretion.</p>\n<h3>✺ LUXURY VEHICLES</h3>\n<p>Two of the most eye-catching vehicles on Dabaran are the splendorous gravcraft Tilides Astrapi and the Metris Khelion.</p>\n<p>The Astrapi has a slender build, with a tear shaped cupola made of combat-resistant ceramic glass that opens up just like those on exo-atmospheric fighters do (upwards and backwards). The craft has two seats and contains an inertia sphere, gravbelts, medimonitor and a semi-intelligent bar. The craft is powered by the Akbar O Akbar grav engine, which is also found in Tilides thermonuclear torpedoes. The engine allows the Astrapi to perform extreme stunts, aerial jumps, and a very impressive vertical climb rate.</p>\n<p>The seven meter long, shiny black Metris Khelion is a six-wheeled luxury vehicle with a glass-like engine hood where the beautifully gear-operated engine core is visible. It comes fully supplied with Abdal-chai, a kawah-steamer and a bar stocked with vintage wine, spiced liqueurs and syrup made from haram nuts. The top of the line modulateprojectors and a fantastic audio system makes it sound as if Sani Sowal herself sat next to you, singing her baria ballads. All the seats have a built-in morph feature that automatically adapts to the passenger, and are made from Dabaran bloodox leather.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

Every cycle, several gas trawlers disappear in the cloud veils of Salamanxes' upper atmosphere. The presence of the rapidly orbiting Exilion sometimes destabilizes the portal fields, which causes portal storms to erupt. The planet Dabaran also suffers strange weather phenomena and wild creatures, both dangerous to its people and their spacecraft.</p>\n<h2>HOME OF THE DJINNI</h2>\n<p>Nowhere in the Third Horizon are Djinni as well regarded as on Dabaran. Here, Djinni are perceived as good – or at least neutral. Dabaran myth and legend is full of tales about a Djinn safely leading wanderers and caravans to their destination, protecting the weak, or averting diseases.</p>\n<p>Oasis domes, palaces, seraglios and souks all feature small altars where one can present gifts to the local Djinn. The Djinni exists in several forms on Dabaran, from the animalistic Nasah to the human-like Silah and Safrah. Silah are house-djinni who often hide in harems or cloisters, often in the form of a beautiful and intelligent concubine or prophet. According to folklore, they protect their dwelling and their master against ill fortune and evil spirits.</p>\n<p>Safrah are tricksters who live in bazaars and markets where they protect against ill-fortune, but also cause mischief. The Safrah Gilmaseh at the Dar Bahri souk is said to have stopped the great fire of CC58, but is also considered to be the instigator of the oyster disease of CC59 that affected several palaces in the region.</p>\n<h2>IRON STORMS</h2>\n<p>The highlands are regularly hit by red iron storms, sometimes called “The Visage of the Judge”. The iron-rich desert creates a phenomenon similar to static charges, that sucks up microscopic sand particles into the atmosphere and then scatters them across the plains. The charged particles get almost everywhere, affecting vehicles, exo-suits and sometimes even shuttles heading into space. These storms can last days. The mathematical institute in Daddah usually provides forecasts, warning of these storms.</p>\n<h2>MEME POWDER</h2>\n<p>Ansara’s amaranthine desert is found at the edge of the lowland ravines. The desert is filled with razor sharp rocks and crystals that have been whittled down into a fine powder by recurring storms. For a long time, this powder was used to dye ceramics and cloth, until Dabaran alchemists discovered the powder’s medicurgical properties. The powder can affect a person’s mind and body in different ways depending on what other ingredients they are combined with.</p>\n<p>When the wind turns from its usual eastward direction and collides with the western Djinnwind, the resulting storms carry the powder far into the lowlands. This is a rare event that might occur once in a lifetime, but always with disastrous consequences. The Dar Farzagu Mayhem is one example where the winds left a trail of madness and destruction among several oases and palaces along the lowland slopes.</p>\n<h2>GRAVITATIONAL SPHERES</h2>\n<p>In the lowland ravines, tales abound about Djinni and other spirits toying with lost wanderers and herders. Without warning, a victim can be snatched up into the blue sky and left floating for days until they plummet to the ground just as unexpectedly as they went up. Geologists and gravitational scientists have named this phenomenon the “zero-gravitational anomaly”, but the Dabarans themselves call it gravitational spheres.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, these spheres are filled with powder, sand and dust that shift and swirl in mystical patterns. These spheres make for excellent places for contemplation where one can experience glimpses of the future – something that makes the spheres popular with the philosophers of the Seeker’s Circle. Approaching a sphere is not without risk, as Djinni often reside nearby – and seem to have an easier time possessing or tricking people near the spheres.</p>\n<h2>THE DABARI LION</h2>\n<p>Despite its name, the Dabari Lion is not a feline creature, but rather a domestic xenomorph of the Dabaran lowlands. It has a cat-like head with a mane of fine tentacles used for communication and mating. Skin-clad bone plates protrude from the spine, like a jagged mountain range. The lions hunt in packs and sometimes target caravans or sneak into servant cities to snatch human prey. In spite of this, the species is protected and only exalted emirs and their equals may hunt them. The mane-tentacles are said to improve one’s senses when ingested, making them expensive on the black market controlled by poachers from the Syndicate.</p>\n<h2>DESDEMODU</h2>\n<p>The giant herbivore Desdemodu slowly waddle through the cold, stony deserts of Dabaran. For as long as anyone can remember, they have been venerated for their wisdom by the people of Lotus. Desdemodu wander around the planet in a slow migration, but seem to be more common around the Wound. In the last few cycles, the peculiar horns of the Desdemou have become popular in other systems for their aphrodisiac properties, and the Latifa have been hardpressed to catch and deter illegal poachers.</p>\n<h2>THE JADE MONKEY</h2>\n<p>South of the city Merkab-al-Kour lies the Galrada Plains, a part of the stone desert that has been taken over by bio-sculpted grass plains. The Nomads here tell stories of a jade statue, a material not native to Dabaran. The statue is said to depict King Karak, a nature spirit in the form of a gigantic simian. It is said that Karak will awaken when the nomads are threatened by invaders of the plains. A digsite at the Merkab Ravine, organized by the Markadu company, has recently run into problems, with destroyed equipment, expedition members gone missing, and communication interference.</p>\n<h2>MIRTHRA’S RING</h2>\n<p>On the eastern plateau, at the rim of the cold desert of Yagoi, stands a singular wall - a remnant from a time before humans first walked the planet. Defiantly, it reaches for the sky, it’s smooth and grey surface slowly narrowing at its kilometer high apex. The wall is actually a ring, several hundred kilometers in diameter, that stands out from the plateau and is constructed from an unknown material. Analysis by Dabaran scientists and Foundation geochemists has shown that the wall most likely consists of some form of inert nanite material. This is probably the explanation for it not being affected by wind or time.</p>\n<p>The climate inside the wall is warmer than the rest of the plateau and both air pressure and oxygen levels are higher. No emirate or khanate has claimed the location because it is considered to be bound to the Djinni, though a company of bionically modified pilgrims with telepathic abilities have settled at the center of the ring. They’ve taken the name Mithra’s Children, after the old Dabaran name for the Judge - Mirthra. What their purpose inside the ring is, no one knows.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
