{"_id":"1NV0zlY32m702DVR","name":"04 - Locations in the Altai System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE ALTAI SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>The Altai system is famous for its immense asteroid belt. But it also contains other wonders. The gas giant Elajh is home to the Gas Emirs. Meanwhile, the ice-covered Maraabra is known for its large deposits of aluminium – a resource the Consortium covets, but has difficulty reaching due to the planet’s location beyond the Black Sector.</p>\n<h2>IMANON</h2>\n<p>Imanon, the planet closest to the system's star, has been called the Janus Face of Altai. Its orbit is transfixed so that one side constantly points towards the star while the other faces the void. This has turned one side of the planet into an inhospitable surface on which a variety of molten metals flows. The other side is a frozen wasteland of rock covered in enormous craters and canyons. Toxic gases make the planet’s atmosphere unbreathable.</p>\n<p>The planet has a single permanent settlement. Most people on the planet inhabit one of the many mobile mining facilities on the surface. Many are bound by slave contracts, but this is changing due to the slave revolts on Zanjire. A Consortium-supported affiliate, the Altai Cartel, is establishing a presence on the planet's dark hemisphere. But its progress is slow as a number of politically motivated murders haunt the organization. The Magnesium Sultans are another political actor on the planet. They live in powerful crawlers that journey deep into the canyons of the planet's dark hemisphere. As Imanon is located close to the portal fields and is inside the Black Sector, it is one of the system’s more accessible locations for Zenithians to reach and exploit.</p>\n<h2>THE BLACK SECTOR</h2>\n<p>Altai’s military proficiency relies on an ancient security system that was created by the first colonists during the cataclysmic Portal Wars. The security system is located in the gigantic asteroid cloud that resides between the portal fields and the majority of the system. Torpedo chambers were secretly built in the belt’s rocks. These were filled with both troops in stasis and devastating automatic missile systems.</p>\n<p>This defence network is known as the Black Sector. There are two known routes through it: the Yamuna Trail and the Tang Gol-path.</p>\n<p>The Black Sector is controlled by the Alabaster Council and is one of the reasons the Zenithians can’t eradicate the Council and its irksome corsairs. The defense network also contributes to the system's economy and security, as the well-defined trade routes make it relatively easy to scrutinize and tax travelers. How the defense network is maintained remains an enigma to this day.</p>\n<h2>ALTAI</h2>\n<p>The planet which gives the Altai system its name is a colossal chunk of rock surrounded by 27 moons. The bestknown settlement is on Altai-17 where the famed courtesans – the Sirens of Achelos – conduct a carnal sacrament to honour the Faceless One. Besides this, a small mining operation has developed on the planet and its moons. But its proximity to Khorsabad means prospectors seldom get to keep their profits, unless they choose to pay patronage to the Alabaster Council.</p>\n<h2>ZANJIRE</h2>\n<p>This planet was once a slave colony. Massive farms run by slave merchant families and relying on indentured labor produced such high crop yields that Zanjire was known as the breadbasket of the entire Altai system. But the slaves revolted in a large-scale uprising. These insurrectionists formed the confederation of new Zanjire and pressured the families – the one-time rulers of the planet – to hand over all they owned to the public. Since then it has become home to a broad spectrum of people trying to realize their dreams and aspirations.The insurrectionists have also started making demands on its planetary neighbors.</p>\n<p>The uprising’s repercussions were felt all the way to the Alabaster Council, resulting in its reformation into its eighth constellation. Zanjire is also home to a new interpretation of the Icon faith known as the Path of the Elders, which has taken control of the planet with the people’s support.</p>\n<h2>BAATAR</h2>\n<p>Baatar once enjoyed a highly successful mining economy and was considered the jewel in the crown of Marakanda. For many cycles now, it has been the site of a brutal civil war between local warlords and the planet’s vizirs, who fight over the planet's resources and its only space port, Kamesh. </p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

Today, the system is controlled by a mishmash of different lords, merchant houses, and corsair families – all of whom answer to the system’s house of representatives, the Alabaster Council. The Council rules from Khorsabad on the dwarf planet Marakanda. Khorsabad has been built on the ruins of a planet-spanning city-state that shared the planet's name. During its golden age, the city-state of Marakanda rivalled the Horizon's two other cultural centers, Mira and Dabaran.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"AZ3yetwCcbWhwpoI","name":"03 - Altai Today","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>ALTAI TODAY</h1>\n<p>Altai’s greatness is found in its past. The fragments that remain are worn down, unproductive settlements and abandoned colonies. The system’s underpopulated settlements are filled with rugged buildings and adorned with old monuments to past glories and great thinkers. The system – once centrally controlled – is today governed by the military might of local robber barons, whose sole concern is paying required tithes to their superior, no matter the cost. At the top of the chain sits the Alabaster Council in Khorsabad, which dominates Altai and its inhabitants.</p>\n<h2>THE ALABASTER COUNCIL</h2>\n<p>Contrary to what many outsiders believe, the Alabaster Council is not a united political congregation. Rather, it’s quite the opposite. Council members constantly try to outmaneuver each other for their own gains. These internal struggles mean the politics of the Altai system are in constant turmoil.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Constellation of the infamous Alabaster Council currently rules from the old Alabaster Hall, founded by the rajahs of Kushtriya. The Council has devolved into a loosely-connected federation of clans that craft and issue joint decrees for the system and most of its settlements.</p>\n<p>The representatives who occupy seats in the Council clothe themselves in opulence, which is seen as a criterion for the office. To obtain a seat at the Council, it is required that a majority elect the clan, person, or – in rare cases – company to represent them. In addition, there must be an open seat, or one that’s soon to become vacant. A byelection is held when a seat opens up – for example, because a member has been dismissed.</p>\n<p>The current Council consists of 51 seats but the number varies wildly between constellations. All Council members have the right to raise one issue per meeting, which the Council must then take a stand on. The real statecraft occurs under the lotus; in the city’s tea houses, during wrestling competitions, in the bath houses, or during banquets.</p>\n<p>One of the most influential families in the Council is Artabazus, led by the matriarch Genya Artabazus. This stoic woman has proven to be a dangerous political adversary, who has destroyed many political opponents in short order.</p>\n<h2>THE CORSAIRS</h2>\n<p>The corsairs that operate on behalf of the Alabaster Council play an important role in the Quadrant. They are political pawns but are also economic powerhouses that serve as traders and lines of communication between the Moguls of the Janhagir Fleet and the permanent settlements in the four systems. The major corsair families – sometimes known as collectives – have recently endured several changes after the most vital trade route in the Horizon was rerouted through the Quadrant.</p>\n<p>The corsair collectives conduct raids across the Quadrant and beyond. The members assist each other under the principle of “seize and cut”, claiming a portion of any profit from a trade, after the appropriate tithe has been paid to the Alabaster Council. Some collectives – such as the Varanasi and the Mharatta – are large enough to operate organized training facilities for their privateers.</p>\n<p>The Alabaster Council’s corsairs are not the only ones operating in the Quadrant. Council families may, for a price, grant a letter of marque – known as an Alabaster Boon – to any corsairs, regardless of their place of origin.</p>\n<h3>✺ ALTAI’S DEFENSE FORCE</h3>\n<p>Recently, a newly-formed corsair group called “Altai’s Defense Force”, or the ADF for short, has hijacked several ships along the Odacon route towards Mira. The group's shadow council has vowed to the Icons and the Venerated that it will only target ships equipped with the beacon tags of the Consortium and those that can otherwise be identified as Zenithian. The group aims to disrupt the Zenithian trade in the Altai system. During their raids the corsairs have demonstrated exceptional cruelty, but only towards Zenithian crews. The Consortium, the Legion and Zenithian affiliates of the Free League have signed a decree to counter the growing movement with force. However, the Zenithians’ hands are tied as the Moguls of the Janhagir Fleet, the Alabaster Council, and the Order of the Pariah disapprove of the decree and have taken their objections all the way to the Council of Factions.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE CORSAIR TREATIES</h3>\n<p>The Corsair Treaties are the alliance decrees that are supposed to limit corsair raids on ships traversing the Quadrant. The treaties have several clauses, but in short stipulate that the signed parties – the Legion, the Consortium and the Zenithian affiliates of the Free League – shall protect and aid each other in the fight against corsair activities within the Quadrant of the Pillar. However, it has come to pass that the Legion is bound to various older agreements with the Moguls and the Alabaster Council that limit the Legion’s contribution to providing escorts for allied ships within the system. Due to the Legion’s split loyalties, several independent military enterprises have free range in the cold vacuum of the Quadrant – a situation some claim is worse than the threat of the corsairs.</p>\n<h3>✺ CORSAIR TACTICS</h3>\n<p>The dark void of space is vast and impossible to monitor at all times. Experienced corsairs consider it foolish to attempt to lie in wait for freighters and other ships. The corsairs of Altai operate in a different manner – employing a raiding technique that has since been copied by privateers across the rest of the Horizon. The tactic relies on a wide range of information sources and networks that provide the corsair captains with a continuous, bountiful supply of intel. From this, the captains can make quick decisions on which raids to conduct. The Altai corsair's vast intelligence network and cipher technique is something that the Consortium deeply covets.</p>\n<h2>ARMED WITH A SILVER TONGUE</h2>\n<p>One of the commonalities of the Altai system is the employment of smooth-tongued poets by different Council families to act as their mouthpieces to the general populace. Many poets in Khorsabad, and further beyond in the system, launched their cultural careers by retelling the Council’s many meetings, editing the stories to benefit their patron family. One of the most successful poets of Khorsabad is the Baala Hadad, whose poems are reputed to have made some Council families abdicate and others free their slaves. The poet herself lives a precarious existence in the city's many houses of ill repute and her taste for hallucinogenic drugs has put her in harm's way more than once. She is protected by a number of influential benefactors, but their patience is growing thin.</p>\n<h2>PENALTIES ON ALTAI</h2>\n<p>There is less focus on morality within the Quadrant of the Pillar than in other parts of the Horizon. This is especially true in Altai, where the philosophy of life is based on the motto, “If no one discovered it was me, then my actions were not criminal”. Altai has penalties of varying severity, depending upon the social strata of the person found guilty. However, being caught in the act or exposed as a liar are two of the gravest things that can happen to a person: Those of lower classes often commit ritual suicide to atone for these sins, while members of the upper classes accept selfimposed permanent exile.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"HjtpwzcgmDee42Ei","name":"07 - Locations in Khorsabad","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN KHORSABAD</h1>\n<p>Khorsabad’s sun feather-shaped domes accommodate a multitude of exciting venues for the visitor to experience.</p>\n<h2>THE BAZAAR DISTRICT</h2>\n<p>The Bazaar District is the heart of Khorsabad. The system’s raiding economy has turned this district into a cornucopia – filled with merchandise of every description, originating both from within the Quadrant and from across the Third Horizon. Goods are traded at all hours in the Bazaar District. The buyers and sellers may change, but the commerce itself never stops. All goods sold here are contraband in some form or another – a situation that surprises nobody.</p>\n<p>The bazaar provides delights for all of a visitor’s senses – but none more so than the senses of smell and taste. Here, spices, salves, oils, and incenses offer relief from the unpleasant odors that characterize the rest of the crowded city. Meantime, mouths water and tongues tingle at the variety of exotic fruit, fresh meals prepared to order, and refreshing hot or cold beverages – all reflecting the city’s fusion of cultures. From the market’s many food stalls to long-established restaurants, the bazaar is a gastronome’s delight.</p>\n<p>Despite the tremendous variety of goods and services that are traded here and the impressive amount of birr that changes hands each day, the Bazaar District is surprisingly serene. This is due to the fact that no single Council member or family has jurisdiction here. Rather, the merchants themselves govern the bazaar through negotiated consensus.</p>\n<p>The Bazaar District is divided into stalls or sections in which merchants display their wares. The spice traders are grouped together in one area, the porcelain mongers in another, the slavers in a third, and so on. Of course there are merchants who offer a broad selection of wares, but the specialist traders disapprove of these “mediocre generalists” and to appease a majority of the merchants these traders have been consigned to the outskirts. While merchants frequently disagree about how the bazaar should be run, all agree that consensus is better than having rules imposed by an outside authority. All also agree that thieves have no place in the bazaar and those caught stealing are typically tried, convicted and shot on sight.</p>\n<p>While the bazaar is quite active, trade beyond the Black Sector is somewhat limited the Alabaster Council levies customs duties on all goods transported out of the sector.</p>\n<h2>THE EMERALD TEAR</h2>\n<p>The Emerald Tear – also known as the Green Gaze – is the entertainment district in Khorsabad. Located between the spaceport and the bazaar, the district received its name after construction work to expand the city’s water reserves caused a powerful earthquake. During the quake, large chunks of the green dome of Kacche crashed onto the buildings below. Before salvage crews could remove the pieces, they mysteriously fused with the cityscape. The incident has given the district’s buildings a curious appearance, characterized by large, dull shimmering crystals.</p>\n<p>The crystals did not concern the district's inhabitants for long. The district exists to sell temporary bliss and there is no time for brooding thoughts. Instead, the district does its best to live up to the exotic name it acquired – determined to satisfy all comers with the most exotic desires and vices to be found anywhere in the Horizon. Visitors to Khorsabad join the city’s permanent residents in the Emerald Tear to gamble, drink, and dance until all their birr has slipped from their fingers.</p>\n<h2>YAL-HARRA</h2>\n<p>Yal-Harra – the Temple District – is dedicated to prayer and contemplation. The district is one of the few parts of the Raj kingdom that is still preserved in its original form. Yal-Harra has been skillfully preserved by its guardians. According to legend, the warlord Tang Gol proclaimed on his deathbed that Marakanda stands and falls with its virtue to the Icons. Tang Gol was considered a devout Icon worshipper who revered many different doctrines, and this is reflected in the variety of worship found in this district. The warlord's own temple, built by his successors, is a magnificent monument that outshines many of the other ancestral shrines that can be found in the area.</p>\n<h2>THE SPACEPORT</h2>\n<p>The constant activity at the Khorsabad spaceport makes it one of the city’s most important places. If the bazaar is the city's heart, then the spaceport is its lungs. The port is a hive of activity, and its transit halls and docks are alway filled with people or goods awaiting transport to new destinations. The loading of ships, customs processing, ship repairs, and the passage of numerous groups of pilgrims are some of the sights that can be seen in this district. Many of the Alabaster Council’s invitation offices are located in the port, which provides visitors with the opportunity to buy an invitation or adjust one that has already been bought, even if most people who arrive here make their arrangements while still in orbit.</p>\n<h2>THE REMEMBRANCE PLAZA</h2>\n<p>The most elegant area of Khorsabad is found in the innermost core of the sun feather. Here the streets are wide and spotless, the air is easier to breathe, and the ever-present noise that permeates elsewhere in the city is absent. At the center is the Remembrance Plaza. The plaza functions as a gigantic monument to the Ghaziz – the warriors who fought and died under Tang Gol when he conquered the rajahs in two famous battles, at the moons of Altai and Baatar.</p>\n<h2>THE ETERNAL GARDEN</h2>\n<p>The Eternal Garden is one of the most beautiful places in all of Khorsabad. The Alabaster Council has invested enormous amounts of time and birr to create this exquisite garden, the design of which is inspired by all the corners of the Quadrant, but also the Horizon at large. This area is a remnant of the Marakanda of old, and one of the locations that has always been under the protection of the Alabaster Council. If Tang Gol venerated the Icons, then the Council venerates this garden.</p>\n<p>In the centre of the Eternal Garden we find the Alabaster Hall, where men and women in ancient times, with the aid of the public, ruled the Raj kingdom of Marakanda.</p>\n<h2>THE ALABASTER HALL</h2>\n<p>Delicately carved from the cliff wall, Alabaster Hall stands as a mighty expression of the collected authority of Altai. Columns, statues, and sculptures of mythical beasts and ancestors decorate the magnificent hall's facade, which is polished and maintained each day by more than a hundred slaves. If visitors are bedazzled by the exterior, then the interior will leave them completely in awe. Inside, one experiences the very best of Marakandan art. Mosaics, statues, and the constant shimmer of alabaster in all its forms and nuances meld together and make the room come almost alive.</p>\n<p>Altai’s elite gather here almost every day – although it must be noted that there are often empty seats. At the end of each segment, the full Council gathers to fill the hall and discuss the most important issues – both internal and external – that face the republic. Council members who stray from attending these meetings soon face the contempt of their peers and risk being expelled from the Council.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE ALABASTER GUARD</h3>\n<p>The warriors of the Alabaster Guard have sworn to protect the Alabaster Hall, no matter who currently controls it. Members of the guard are recruited at a young age and – providing they survive the squad’s harsh initiation rites – dedicate their lives to the Alabaster Council. Despite all of this, the guard actually plays a marginal role in the Council’s defenses.Since it is rare that anyone threatens the hall or its members, the guard has become a troop of privileged, paunchy oafs that are frequently seen lounging about in the establishments of Khorsabad, wearing their alabaster white guard masks. The guard inspires dread in many who encounter its members but this is due primarily to the squad’s bone white combat exos, which give the members a look of fearsomeness unmatched by combat units anywhere else in the Third Horizon.</p>\n<h2>THE BATHHOUSES</h2>\n<p>The bathhouses serve as important locations for those who live in Khorsabad. Many kinds of baths exist and the bathing culture has become an integral part of the daily routine for many citizens. It is well known that, besides the Supradome, it is the baths that act as a key venue for business and political negotiations in the city. Some of the more famous bathhouses include the renowned Princess of Farat, the palatial Miracle of Gritaris, and the utilitarian but sizable Deckhand’s Mercy.</p>\n<h2>THE SUPRADOME</h2>\n<p>In the District of the Fighting Lions, all manner of competitions and contests are concentrated. The greatest venue here is the Supradome – an enormous arena that’s host to almost all top sporting events and physical trials. As with much else about life in Khorsabad, the city’s sports and games reflect its multicultural heritage.</p>\n<p>The Supradome has become a focal point throughout the Quadrant of the Pillar for sports and other events. Each week, the Supradome hosts chaotic but wildly popular scooter races. These races are an imported sport – originating on the distant planet Nharmanda – but it is here in Khorsabad that they have flourished. In the Supradome, contestants race their low-flying grav-vehicles at breakneck velocity. The reckless tempo of the scooter races usually results in a high number of casualties.</p>\n<h2>THE WRESTLING COLLEGES</h2>\n<p>Wrestling has become another popular sport in Altai. Many wrestlers train from a young age, and competitors gather in Khorsabad from all corners of the Third Horizon. The most popular style is a Zero-g variety. Known as Hai-wrestling, it takes many forms. These include one-on-one competitions, teams contests, and a variant in which the goal is to defend a point in the match ring. There are several wrestling colleges in Altai. Most are concentrated in Khorsabad, but notable schools exist across the system. Sports enthusiasts argue that the highlight of Khorsabad takes place every fifth cycle, when the mighty Janhagir Fleet passes Khorsabad and the great Ring Games take place.</p>\n<h2>THE CLIFF CITY</h2>\n<p>The district known as the Cliff City is home to most of the clerks and officials of Khorsabad. These bureaucrats have the important role of carrying out the will of the Alabaster Council in the city. This district is also home to the headquarters of the Alabaster Guard, as well as the offices and official residences for diplomatic envoys from across the Third Horizon. These include a modest structure that acts as both the local office of the Consortium and the Zenithian embassy. Nestled in a back alley, it’s in no way grandiose but is still a home away from home for people from all levels of the Consortium, including some mid-ranking Zenithians who act as the Consortium’s mouthpiece. The embassy is under the protection of Artabazus, who wishes to show a sign of good faith by welcoming the ambassadors to Khorsabad. This protection is something that is seen with discontent by many delegates of the Council.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"Y9nBrAbRxjaoymdl","name":"02 - The History of Altai","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>HISTORY OF ALTAI</h1>\n<p>The few surviving sources that recount the history of Marakanda describe the dwarf planet as one of the first colonies in the Third Horizon. The settlers made this small chunk of space rock into their new home, and built Marakanda’s wealth on trade with Mira and the thenprosperous Odacon, as well as Algol and Dabaran. The trade hub that emerged in Marakanda allowed the system to flourish and thrive.</p>\n<p>In Altai’s early history, a long and grievous civil war known as the Epkyros set the system aflame and sundered the Quadrant of the Pillar to its very core. But from its ashes rose the kingdom of Marakanda. During this time of recovery and prosperity, Marakanda would blossom into a symbol of a new age in the Quadrant of the Pillar. The Altai system was quickly put in order and the servants of the rajahs were ready to bring the light of civilization to the rest of the Quadrant.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this prosperous age was short lived, and once again the Dark between the Stars lit up with thermonuclear destruction. The spark that set the kingdom aflame was the discovery of ruins below Marakanda, which implied the citystate had been built on remnants of even older settlements. A heated debate ensued among historians, rhapsodes, and the general populace – arousing tempers and creating bad blood all the way up the social ladder to the ruling raj family, Kushtriya. The rajahs went to war to defend their right and honour. This second civil war raged for several cycles and weakened not only the ruling Kushtriya dynasty, but also the entire Altai system.</p>\n<p>After cycles of war, the interloping war lord Tang Gol broke through the outward defenses of the system and ended the conflict with two swift strikes against the warring parties.</p>\n<p>Tang Gol – now an old man – became the new ruler of Altai, and appropriated the ways of the previous rulers. He levied high tariffs on those who wished to use his portals. Those with sufficient firepower, such as the Legion and the Moguls of the Janhagir Fleet, were given dispensation to traverse both the system and the portals without taxation or interference.</p>\n<h2>BIRTH OF KHORSABAD</h2>\n<p>Shortly after taking control of the system, Tang Gol passed away at age 132. After a brief period of calm, the people of Marakanda once again faced turmoil in what would become known as “the third darkness”. According to the blind prophet Nal’ganda, this would become Marakanda’s final woe.</p>\n<p>In an act that would later be called Nal’gandas Dark Segment, Tang Gol’s generals resolved the issue of succession rights by murdering his descendants. Next they focused on the subsequent problem: each other. Following a number of smaller skirmishes, they agreed to put an end to their hostilities in order to create a new, unified republic. This so-called “pirate republic” sought to bury the past – starting with the raj’s most powerful symbol: the city-state of Marakanda. The republic gave the city a new name, “Khorsabad” and encouraged its use among outsiders – and, later, the city’s residents. The kingdom’s former colonies were split between the republic’s new rulers, and reformed to become the property of the rulers themselves – assets to be passed down the generations to their descendants. The republic slowly turned into an oligarchy. Today, only men and women at the very top of the social structure have a vote in government, or influence over its bureaucracy.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"nwdAZ3s7jJIej8B4","name":"05 - Khorsabad","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>KHORSABAD</h1>\n<p>In the far reaches of the Qui-cluster outside the Black Sector, Marakanda slowly traverses its orbit. This dwarf planet, whose rocky surface gleams in turquoise in the darkness of space, is home to one of the most infamous places of the Quadrant: the ferocious Khorsabad. Consisting of a collection of emerald green, elliptical shaped domes that together form the shape of a defiant spider, Khorsabad appears to clamber across the planet’s airless surface.</p>\n<p>The city's grandest and most beautiful dome is the gigantic Dome of Kacche – an artefact of those who first settled the planet. These pioneers forged and constructed the green dome before the devastating Epkyros. Despite its age, the excellence of its construction is to this day unrivalled anywhere in the Horizon.</p>\n<p>Khorsabad has developed in stages and a plethora of cultures has imparted on the city a fascinating architectural design and tone. The city is constructed in a series of irregular half circles and the buildings spread like a fan outwards from the grand halls of the Alabaster Council, in an order generally corresponding to wealth and social status. In an elongated arch, Karat district marks the edge of the city. Here, visitors will discover a bubbling melting pot of merchants, council members and corsairs, seasoned with conspiracies, theology, and all manner of power struggles.</p>\n<h2>BENEATH A GREEN SKY</h2>\n<p>When the light of Altai’s star hits the domes that separate the city from the void, a green shimmer forms that, to the untrained, naked eye, overwhelms all other colors. The star's light on the domes generates a green shimmer that washes over everything in the city. The dwarf planet's position relative to the star determines how much of its light penetrates the domes’ barriers. This waxing and waning has created a natural cycle for the city’s residents, which new arrivals often find stressful.</p>\n<p>Indoors, residents use the same light sources that are common throughout the Horizon, but outside it can be quite taxing on the eyes to handle the green light. To cope, many outsiders resort to different types of eye protection. This makes new arrivals easy to recognize.</p>\n<h2>THE GATEWAY TO THE QUADRANT</h2>\n<p>It is said that Khorsabad is the gateway to the Quadrant of the Pillar and its entire culture, which is not far from the truth. Many of the Quadrant’s inhabitants have made their mark on the city in the form of the arts, cuisine, and doctrines of faith.</p>\n<p>Khorsabad’s citizens are cosmopolitan in nature and have historically been very welcoming of their neighbors in the Quadrant. However, they remain intolerant towards the Zenithians. They do not like Zenithians in their city, nor are they happy about the Zenithian expansion within the Quadrant. The origins of this xenophobia can be traced mainly to the Alabaster Council, which has used its considerable propaganda machine to fabricate and disseminate lies about the Zenithians. The Council is not alone to blame, however: The truth is, Zenithian customs and traditions often seem bizarre to the common person in Khorsabad.</p>\n<p>The city has become one of the Horizon’s great melting pots – a fusion of a diverse range of architectural and artistic styles. This reflects the history of Khorsabad and its workforce. After the fall of the Raj kingdom of Marakanda, the new republic that emerged brought together workers and art – or, more honestly, slaves and plunder – from across the Horizon. From this was born the cultural opulence that is seen in Khorsabad today.</p>\n<p>Some claim that all art in Khorsabad originates from the blood and sweat of others, but this is not entirely true. For example, over the many cycles since the fall of the Raj, a number of Council families have become patrons to notable architects from across the Horizon – inviting them to Khorsabad to live and work under their protection.</p>\n<p>Many freed slaves have also chosen to stay and build their lives in Khorsabad. Each of the city’s districts reflects the artistic expression of a variety of cultures, which contributes to an intensive city vibe. Khorsabad is home to innumerable marvelous mosaics, paintings, and sculptures, even if the majority of them have suffered the ravages of time. Unblemished facades – whether new or older but cared for – are only found in the more exclusive neighbourhoods. Elsewhere in the city, districts have been allowed to deteriorate into a state of benign neglect – a situation that proves many caretakers value birr above aesthetics and cleanliness.</p>\n<h2>POLITICS, LAW, AND ORDER</h2>\n<p>Khorsabad is a dangerous place, not least because its people lack basic legal rights. The Raj kingdom's most important legal norm, The law of Hanud, gave all free individuals in the city merciful legal rights. However, this has been reinterpreted so many times that the protection of the law now only applies to a small percentage of the upper classes. That said, these elite members of Khorsabad society have the right to exercise “protectorates”, granting their protection to individuals, property, and even entire territories. Under this system, there is no difference between a person and an object: Both, for the most part, have an owner.</p>\n<h2>THE VISITOR’S INVITATION</h2>\n<p>For visitors to Khorsabad, it is vital to procure protection. This takes the form of “the visitor’s invitation”. These may be purchased almost anywhere in the Altai system. They are also available in several major trade centers throughout the Horizon. The content of an invitation varies, but it often includes rights that are enforced by an armed escort. Anyone who holds (or has held) a seat in the Alabaster Council may distribute or sell invitations of different varieties and denominations. Some Council families have turned this into a sophisticated business endeavour. But the more highborn families within the Council see this as the lowest form of entrepreneurship that a member can partake in, and actively try to counteract the business via a range of decrees and statutes.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of well-defined regulations for the ordinary citizen or the visitor, the protectorate system works rather well. Even if Council members trade and sell territory between them, it seldom affects the common citizen as all Council members charge similar fees for protection. There is however always gossip of which families provide better or worse quality of service. Order in each area is maintained by each family’s personal guards. </p>\n<h2>A BUYER’S MARKET</h2>\n<p>Khorsabad is known for its substantial trade in weapons. It’s home to one of the largest arms dealer markets in the Horizon. Everything is bought and sold here – from Vulcan carbines to nuclear torpedos. No weapon is considered off limits as long as the buyer has time and birr to spare. The Council of Factions has repeatedly condemned this trade, arguing that it contributes to destabilizing significant regions of the Horizon.</p>\n<h2>THE ICONS AND THE ELDERS</h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Khorsabad has shown high tolerance for its neighbor’s customs and traditions. No doctrines are prohibited in the city, with the exception of the newly established Path of the Elders. The ban is not to be confused with the general veneration of ancestors that is a popular practice with many different iterations around the city.</p>\n<p>An ancestor who is revered by large parts of the population is Mari, who has had an outstanding influence regarding mathematics, commerce, and – according to some – even history. Written sources credit Mari as one of the first founders of Marakanda and the one who calculated the shape of the dome of Kacche. Several families in Khorsabad keep a green jade stone in their home or worn as a necklace, which are displayed on Mari’s commemoration day.</p>\n<p>The general Tang Gol is another ancestor who is revered by many, especially by ferocious corsairs, aggressive merchants, and imperious bureaucrats.</p>\n<h2>MAR-KYBALA</h2>\n<p>Since the time of the Raj kingdom, an Icon-worshiping sect devoted to the Messenger has thrived in the sub-dome MarKybala. The Mar-Kybala sect is known for its celebration, id-Bhaka. This three-day public festival occurs at the start of the segment of the Messenger and always attracts many visitors. The first day of id-Bhaka is celebrated in a sizable and delightful garden that is located in the center of the dome. The organizers deploy special incense and floral scent diffusers that encourage the crickets and cicadas living in the garden’s pine trees to perform their musical chorus for carousing revelers. On the final day, the Icon’s priests perform sacrificial dances – whirling to the music of drums, clarions, flutes, and cymbals until they collapse from exhaustion.</p>\n<h2>TEMPLE OF THE MONKEYS</h2>\n<p>The enigmatic Temple of the Monkeys is located in the satellite habitat, Babd-Tibra. It’s believed the monkeys are seen as sacred animals, and they are not allowed to be harmed in any way. According to many, the monkeys are “the district's first habitants”. The Temple is often visited by pilgrims hailing from all over the Horizon. It’s considered an important stopping point for several pilgrimages.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

The diverse ethic groups that mingle in the city have also been quick to blend different cultural practices – everything from poetry and music to handicrafts or other arts and crafts. This cultural fusion is pervasive throughout the city, and it’s difficult to find any artistic disciplines in Khorsabad that are not a blend of several different influences. However, there are still some disciplines that remain culturally distinct.</p>\n<h2>MOSAICS, POETRY AND RHETORIC</h2>\n<p>The laying of mosaics is one of the most respected art forms in Khorsabad and its practitioners are revered in public speeches throughout the city and its associated satellite habitats. Just below the mosaic makers, the disciplines of poetry and rhetoric comprise the next most venerated forms of art. Elite practitioners of these three art forms often enjoy the favor of important patrons – including many members of the powerful Council families.</p>\n<p>Soraia Akken is a celebrity mosaic maker, whose works are said to be the only modern art to truly emulate the grand works of Marakanda. A former slave, she has forged an illustrious career since her emancipation and has been frequently hired by a number of Khorsabad’s wealthiest families – a situation that has made her most unpopular among many still enslaved.</p>\n<h2>JUNK CULTURE OF THE CORSAIRS</h2>\n<p>Khorsabad and the Altai system also generate an impressive amount of junk entertainment which is broadcast from different satellite stations. Many of these are straight up ripoffs of the Coriolis hit show, The Plantation Owner’s Daughter. Besides the free Bulletin, residents of any major settlement in the system may enjoy a variety of popular serials, including Lang’s Gang, Beyond the Zenithian Law, and Ghost Ships. All these shows portray an embellished Altai existence that encourages the corsair lifestyle, slave trading, and ship raiding – when conducted with the blessing of the Alabaster Council. The shows are very popular, but can seem quite strange to outsiders, as they are filled with much unspoken cultural etiquette.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
