The Firstcome live alone here – sheltered from Zenithian expansion. To the few freighter crews who reach the system, Sivas and her planets appear to be a place frozen in time, with a culture governed by strange celestial phenomena. Despite this harsh first impression, travelers are tempted by the untold riches scattered across the celestial bodies that orbit the Sivas star. Fortune seekers should, however, take heed: the system is ferociously guarded by protective corsairs and distrustful Moguls.</p>\n<h2>Index</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[jeZZS8yuIC3NjlXB]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[XonepjliwzohKZgj]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ufgeJp9ZKRSm4efc]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[6o8W0ILnuE8g9SHa]</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"XonepjliwzohKZgj","name":"02 - Karast and Meddain","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>KARAST AND MEDDAIN</h1>\n<p>The system’s largest population center is set on its smallest celestial body: the lush moon of Karast. While Sivas is a vast, inhospitable and monotone planet, Karast is covered in deep valleys filled with fertile soil, interrupted only by rippling springs and impassable mountains.</p>\n<h2>THE TEN FAMILIES</h2>\n<p>It is said that Karast’s agricultural population is descended from the ten families, the founders who braved the systems of the Quadrant before settling on this tranquil moon orbiting Sivas. Karast is considered a tiny oasis among inhospitable giants. For a long time, Karast remained unknown among the people of the Third Horizon, allowing the society to transform into a true farmer’s republic on the fringe of Firstcome expansion. Each valley had its own representative, and for more than 500 cycles, a farmer’s council ruled from atop a barren mountain where not even a single date would grow – a location that would later become the capital of Meddain.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other locations in the Third Horizon, Karast had a strict patriarchal society even before the arrival of the Lotus Brothers. Council members were exclusively male, and the society was steeped in male ideals and ideas. The priesthood has maintained the tradition of male dominance – either out of pure pragmatism, or for ideological or religious reasons – and no woman has ever been allowed into its ranks.</p>\n<h2>THE CALENDAR OF THE THREE</h2>\n<p>For outsiders, the Icon faith of Karast may seem perverted. The Brotherhood only acknowledges three of the Icons, while the others are seen merely as aspects of The Three. The Judge, Lady of Tears, and the Faceless One form a trinity connected to the three seasons of the moon.</p>\n<p>From planting to harvest, the Judge dominates the religious landscape. This is the period when the weak-willed are condemned and the able-bodied prepare for the harsh winter. In the Karastian fables, the Judge is depicted as an arbiter who decides who lives and who dies.</p>\n<p>When the first snow falls, the Lady of Tears emerges and mourns the ones who have passed on. During this time, the bodies of the deceased are transported from the valleys to their final resting places in rock crevices and mountain peaks. There, The Lady welcomes the righteous into her caring arms and dons the cape of the Executioner for the unworthy.</p>\n<p>When the snow turns to running water at the beginning of spring, Meddain is cleansed of religious symbols and prayers to the Faceless One are spoken in all alcoves of the city. From the top of Opal Hill, the high priest proclaims the beginning of a new cycle – one that is innocent and pure from the sins of the past.</p>\n<h2>THE LOTUS BROTHERS</h2>\n<p>The Lotus Brothers, Karast’s governing body, is said to originate from a world far beyond the Quadrant’s borders. Only those in the innermost circles of the Brotherhood know of its precise origin. There are wild theories – ranging from a sect born on Dabaran to a religious congregation from Sadaal. The most common theory, and the one that most Karastians unite behind, is that the Brotherhood arrived during a period of severe crisis and it used this crisis to establish a strong position of power. The farmer’s republic was crushed and a reactionary theocracy was formed in its place. For some, especially for those living in the teeming Meddain, the Brotherhood’s arrival changed very little.. For them, new opportunities opened up thanks to the administrative assignments provided by the Brotherhood. But in remote valleys, resistance is growing as farmers preparefor a day when they will rise up and reclaim their right of self-governance.</p>\n<p>The Lotus Brothers are ruled by a small inner circle, headed by a lone grandmaster known as the Executor. The current Executor, Rasul Qa Bellem, has occupied his position for more than 20 cycles. (There is some uncertainly over just how long Rasul Qa Bellem has been in power, as official documents are unavailable to the common citizen and public date-keeping is non-existent to the point where keeping a calendar is prohibited.) The coming and going of the seasons is announced by decree of the inner circle, with processions of chime-ringing priests leaving Meddain at each change of season to travel across Karast. Peasants prepare to plant their first crops of spring when the sun rises earlier in the morning and a long procession of chiming priests is sighted on the trails through the mountain passes.</p>\n<h2>THE GISAENG</h2>\n<p>For outsiders, the Gisaeng act as the first contact with Karast’s government. They guide visitors, negotiate with traders, and perform the administrative duties of the city. Their shining garb offers a strong contrast to the greyishbrown clothing favored by the masses of craftsmen and farmers that dominate the city’s social strata. In many ways, the Gisaeng combine the duties of a civil servant with those of a courtesan. For ambitious Karastians, the Gisaeng is the highest achievable position in the social hierarchy. The Gisaeng are prevented from becoming permanent actors of power among Karast’s indigenous population by two factors: first, they are banned from procreating so cannot form dynasties. Second, the Lotus Brothers have designed the selection process, so that only juvenile farmers who are absolutely loyal to the Brotherhood may become Gisaeng.</p>\n<h2>THE MURSALEEN</h2>\n<p>The priesthood has its own intelligence agency at its disposal — the Mursaleen. These agents are recruited in a manner similar to the Gisaeng — from among the local population at an early age. They are then trained under brutal conditions to become loyal henchmen of the Lotus Brothers. Among Karast’s inhabitants, the agents are known as Danda — a term that can be traced back to executioners or someone who carries out a punishment, but also as a slur regarding the agent’s physical characteristics. Danda is mainly a slang term used for the eunuchs of the past, who were a common occurrence in the old farmer’s republic. Whether the Mursaleen are actually eunuchs is a rumor that is hotly debated. That said, it’s known that part of a Mursaleen’s training involves a veritable cocktail of chemical compounds, which enhances some physical traits while impairing others. The Mursaleen are recognized by their long, soot grey kaftans and the lotus tattoo which adorns their necks. These agents are seldom armed with projectile weapons. Instead, they relying on Dura claws and, on occasion, swords of seemingly ceremonial design.</p>\n<h2>THE HAND OF KHENSUR</h2>\n<p>The Traditionalists, or the Hand of Kenshur as they are known, consists of the most stalwart descendants of the original ten families of Karast. This group opposes the tyrannical regime of the Lotus Brothers, and got its name from its signature of leaving behind a white handprint after each raid on government assets. The handprint symbolizes the sacrifice of Kenshur – the last chairman of the republic – who had his hands and feet cut off for refusing to bow down to the Brotherhood. This event caused the fall of the republic and the takeover of the Lotus Brothers. The Brotherhood claims Khensur embezzled the republic’s assets and stockpiled grain for his personal estate – an action that, amongst the citizens of Karast, is the most heinous crime of all. The Traditionalists claim that Khensur was innocent, and so they strike back at their oppressors in his name.</p>\n<p>In Meddain, the movement is not looked upon favorably. Many citizens have accepted the official story about Khensur – a tale spread by the priests through pamphlets, rumors, and bribery. According to the priests, the Hand of Khensur is nothing but a gang of robbers and bandits, spreading terror among the alleys of Meddain and murdering innocent farmers in the valleys. The Traditionalists have had trouble gathering support from the population at large. However, they have found respite, and established a recruitment base, in a remote valley where the old ways are still followed, and where the Mursaleen dare not journey.</p>\n<h2>LOCATIONS ON KARAST</h2>\n<p>Despite its bountiful soil, there are very few large cities on Karast. Besides the capital of Meddain, locations of interest are few and far between.</p>\n<h2>MEDDAIN</h2>\n<p>The narrow and trampled streets of dirt and soil twist like snakes throughout the city, hemmed in by buildings gilded with cedar wood, brimming with people in grayish-brown kaftans, and frequently ending in blind alleys. It’s easy for the unaccustomed visitor to become lost in this noisy, confusing maze. Opal Hill is home to the Lotus Brothers, whose palace occupies a fifth of the city and contains an observatory, a library, and housing for the entire ministry of Brotherhood priests. During certain hours of the day, its white tiled roofs and silver ornaments cause the palace to shine with an intensive glow that can be seen from miles away.</p>\n<h2>THE FORBIDDEN ZONE OF TANZUL</h2>\n<p>High atop the Penche mountains and far beyond the fertile valleys in the south, a vast and windswept salt plateau breaks up the moon's repetitive patchwork of valleys and peaks. Only a handful of plant species can survive in this hostile environment. But during the spring, when meltwater pours from the surrounding mountains, life flourishes on the plateau and adjacent valleys. For generations, local herders have taken advantage of the sudden infusion of life and the subsequent source of salt, but these seasonal visitors are no longer alone. Recently, a strange procession of Lotus Brothers has been seen moving steadily towards the plateau, accompanied by an extraordinary ornate ark. The herders are always watchful of the banners waving in the wind, a warning sign that quickly prompts them to hide among the mountain crevices because the Brotherhood recently declared the plateau to be forbidden ground. Violating this edict is punishable by death.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"jeZZS8yuIC3NjlXB","name":"01 - Locations in the System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE SYSTEM</h1>\n<h2>KALA</h2>\n<p>Over the span of millions of cycles, the gas planet Kala has slowly traversed inwards towards the system’s star. The inevitable death dance between the small gas planet and the vast, flaming sphere has disrupted the trajectory of the planet Sivas, severely compromising the planet’s ecosystem. No prospecting is currently taking place on Kala. Strange stories of abnormal sensor echoes in its depths have puzzled visiting merchants for generations.</p>\n<h2>SIVAS</h2>\n<p>This enormous rock planet is shrouded by a yellow-brown atmosphere above a smooth and strikingly featureless planet crust. The absence of tectonics and the dry atmosphere have resulted in a bleak landscape without any significant weather patterns other than occasional dust storms and infrequent thunderclouds. The temperature rarely rises above freezing and the biting cold is relentless. Remnants of large river systems and fossilised plants hint at a significantly more biodiverse past on Sivas, which now only harbors the occasional thorny thicket and frost-resistant weeds.</p>\n<p>Despite its desolation, some visitors claim that a longer stay can be revitalizing for both mind and body. The planet’s relatively strong gravity and thin atmosphere force the muscles, lungs and heart to acclimatize – providing visitors to Sivas a short-lived but life-affirming vitality when they return to their home planets.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE GRAND FURROW</h3>\n<p>From space, the Grand Furrow appears like a gigantic wound that runs between the poles of the planet. Early on, brave prospectors from Markanda in the Ordana system discovered immense deposits of bauxite here. However, this knowledge was lost after the fall of Markanda and was not rediscovered until the arrival of the Mogul clans at the end of the Portal Wars.</p>\n<p>The nomads had heard tales of vast riches from the descendants of those who once used the bauxite deposits to fatten their pockets. Acutely aware of the conflicts that would inevitably arise if this information was made public in the Quadrant, the captains of the Mogul fleet initiated small-scale mining operations –extracting just enough to keep the Janhagir Fleet running. The Mogul clan Korijaq operates the largest quarries, but several other clans are trying to enter the market.</p>\n<h3>✺ AT THE FURROW’S BRINK</h3>\n<p>Three landing platforms are scattered along the Furrow. The Moguls have prohibited the carrying of weapons here and strictly enforce this edict. The largest platform features a watering hole known as Jamal’s Cantina, run by the Ashira – the daughter of the now-deceased Jamal. The cantina is located strategically on a cliffside facing the planet’s largest colonies, Jerhyn’s Prospect and Southern Lode. The cantina functions as a meeting spot and entertainment establishment for the miners, and for the few crews that visit the planet.</p>\n<p>Southern Lode is famous for a general store called Ribaat’s Forge. Known by the locals as simply “Ribaat’s”, it’s frequented by prospectors looking to buy hand-forged tools, imported provisions, and the locally produced ayran beverage.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE NOMAD TAX</h3>\n<p>Mining is seen as beneath a Mogul’s dignity, so most mining operations on Sivas are performed by indentured labour. As the Janhagir Fleet makes its long journey through the Quadrant, it picks up many fortune seekers who are tempted by promises of birr, food, and lodging. These workers fall into debt to the Moguls during their journey, and upon arrival at Sivas they are expected to toil laboriously to repay what they owe. Workers can expect to keep less than a fifth of the profits generated by the ore they mine.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE KALAS-SIVAS CONJUNCTION</h3>\n<p>Every eleventh cycle, during the Dancer’s segment, all mining operations grind to a halt on Sivas. The priests of Meddain vanish for days and the inhabitants of Karast cower in underground bunkers. This is when the gas giant Kala and Sivas align themselves with the Sivas star, causing a titanic cosmological phenomenon known as the Kalas-Sivas Conjunction. The gravity of Kalas affects her smaller cousins to such a degree that previously unknown springs erupt from the ground on Karast and new cracks appear in the Grand Furrow on Sivas. For prospectors, this provides a golden opportunity to find new bauxite deposits. For others, this is a time of despair as the conjunction provides a grim reminder that Kalas’ slow descent into the Sivas star will one day collide with the system’s portal fields, potentially causing them to collapse entirely.</p>\n<h2>LOULAN</h2>\n<p>The trade hub Loulan is permanently anchored in the Lagrange point formed by the planet Sivas and the system’s star, and provides a haven for any unfortunate freighters that are denied landing permission on Karast or Sivas. The station is maintained by a motley crew led by the Jibre family. The family claims that Loulan is the only legitimate trading post in Sivas thanks to an old treaty with the nowdeposed farmers republic of Karast which states, “The Jibre shall be the right hand of the Merchant for as long as the lotus-covered hills of Karast shine blue in springtime”. Today, this treaty is willfully ignored by the Moguls and anyone else who has no need of Loulan’s services. Most outsiders, however, respect the claim because Loulan is the only neutral gathering spot for the system’s visitors.</p>\n<h2>THE OUTER ICE PLANETS</h2>\n<p>Farthest out in the system, the small ice planets Nurija, Gamhija, and Comija reside in slow orbit. They are quite hard to tell apart thanks to their similar luminescence. Every 80th cycle they form a line in the Karast night sky. Unlike the Kalas conjunction, this is seen as an omen of good things to come. Each night, Gamhija and Comija slowly inch their way closer to Nurija, and the Lotus Brothers are preparing for the symbolic convergence as they first arrived in the system during the last convergence of these two heavenly objects.</p>\n<p>Not much is known about the planets and nobody ever really bothers to visit them. Most see them as uninteresting celestial bodies, too far away to be worthy of exploration.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
