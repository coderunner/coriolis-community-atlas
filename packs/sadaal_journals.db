{"_id":"05q8qA23MclLQ9rm","name":"07 - Dangers and Phenomena","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>DANGERS AND PHENOMENA</h1>\n<p>The Sadaal system endured many horrors during the Portal Wars, and those wounds have not yet healed. There are innumerable natural dangers as well as unnatural threats and mysterious phenomena. Many believe Aremerat and the Institute of Protection shield the population from these great evils.</p>\n<h2>ASHEGRID, THE BLACK SUN</h2>\n<p>According to forbidden legends, the first star in the Sadaal-A system was Ashegrid. When holy Aremerat took the people under his protection, that star was extinguished and Aremerat instead lit Sadaal – a warmer star that would comfort the people after the sandstorms and icy winters brought on by the Portal Wars.</p>\n<p>According to astrogators, Ashegrid remains as a black drop that sometimes passes across Sadaal's brilliant face. On such occasions, the djinn and ghosts of the Portal Wars are said to awaken and the Icon of the Whisperer becomes clearer in prophecy. Being born under the black sun is considered to be the highest degree of bad luck.</p>\n<h2>THE CAVE DWELLERS</h2>\n<p>Deep below the mountains of Shimush are the remains of the bunkers and cave systems used during the Portal Wars. Many have been rendered impassable by the passage of time — and the Institute of Protection has sealed off the few that remain. Still, these underground complexes seem to be a refuge for at least one group of dissidents. Nobody knows how they survive — but raiders regularly target villages, remote industrial complexes, or even the lower areas of Alburz.</p>\n<p>These raiders are known as the Cave Dwellers. They primarily loot for provisions, but they also kidnap men, women and children. The locals whisper that those captured are taken away to a fate worse than death. The Cave Dwellers are said to worship a dark aspect of the Dancer known as Chaarbydha, “the wonder at the end of time”.</p>\n<h2>THE GEUSTASA AND THE PALE GHOSTS</h2>\n<p>On Sadaal's steppes, millions of buffalo roam in a perpetual search for pasture and water. These herds are managed by the Geustasa, a nomadic people who live outside mainstream Sadaalian society. The Geustasa structure their society around their herds and live in strictly hierarchical tribes ruled by the oldest women in the group.</p>\n<p>Several times a year, the Geustasa drive their herds to a massive slaughter complex where thousands of animals are culled and butchered. This is the only time the nomads have regular contact with others.</p>\n<p>Workers tend to keep their distance from the slaughter stations when the Geustasa bring in their herds. This is because – despite having no evidence to support their view – many Sadaalians believe the Geustasa to be bloodthirsty barbarians. This reputation is undeserved, but the Amesha Spenta has cultivated it over tens of cycles in an effort to keep Sadaalians in the cities where they can be most easily controlled. The Geustasa are equally well-served by the rumors of their savagery, since any would-be intruders stay far away from their steppes.</p>\n<p>Every night, Geustasa fires dot the endless reaches of the steppes – a common sight for laborers taking the trains back into the cities at the end of their two-week shifts in the slaughter complex. Sometimes, pale ghosts can be seen dancing wildly around the nomad’s fires. The laborers fear these are djinns, but the true nature of the pale ghosts that visit the campfires of the Geustasa is a closely guarded secret that has never been revealed.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE ETERNAL HUNGER</h3>\n<p>The Geustasa nomads of Sadaal tell stories of dead buffalo they have found on the plains – animals that are only skin and bones despite living and thriving only days before their corpses were discovered. Around their fires, the nomads whisper about the Tarwich, soulless spirits afflicted with endless hunger.</p>\n<p>The workers in the slaughterhouses have heard these stories, and carried them onto the trains and into the cities. There the tales are retold in the bars by over-refreshed laborers, soliciting loud laughter at the expense of “the superstitious herders.” But when darkness falls and the cold winds blow in from the steppes, the laughter becomes nervous, and workers look over their shoulders on the way home. Rumor has it that the Institute of Protection has found desiccated corpses. Perhaps there is a grain of truth in the tales told by the Geustasa.</p>\n<h2>NAMTAR'S WINDS</h2>\n<p>On southern Bahram, far from the thriving cities, vast fields of ruins stretch out as far as the eye can see. Before the Portal Wars, this area was home to several cities around the big lakes connecting to the Namtar Sea farther south.</p>\n<p>The Iconocrats have banned all access to the area, and automated weapon systems keep the curious away. The official reason given for the ban is the so-called Namtar's Winds. While the sea and the lakes are usually bathed in a deceptive calm, fierce storms erupt several times a year. Channeled through the mountain passes and over the destroyed towns, the storms blow towards the sea. Along the way, the winds pick up radioactive dust from the Portal Wars, hurling it with all the force of a hurricane over the forests and swamps to the north.</p>\n<p>Some of the southern cities are hit hard by Namtar's Winds, but it is the swamps and forests that suffer the most. The dust has distorted and changed the forests so greatly that the Foundation has applied several times to lead expeditions to investigate and catalog new animal species and plants. These requests have all been denied.</p>\n<p>Some believe the Iconocrats have other reasons for banning access to the area. Official expeditions including heavy vehicles have been seen traveling towards Namtar on several occasions. Those who ask too many questions about these convoys disappear. It’s said they’ve been “dragged away by the ghosts of Namtar.”</p>\n<h2>HAKAD’S VORTEX</h2>\n<p>The atmosphere above Bahram's cerulean sea is periodically disrupted by unexplained electromagnetic discharges. These outbursts are almost invisible on weather sensors but can sometimes be seen from orbit as a colorful vortex in the sky.</p>\n<p>Devout Sadaalians believe that Hakad the Whisperer sends the vortex to punish the Consortium and their settlements on the Newlands. Ships caught by Hakad’s Vortex often find their electronic systems completely knocked out. Occasionally, a vortex has hit the ground on one of the Newlands' urban islands, resulting in widespread power outages.</p>\n<h2>THE DANCER'S TIDAL WAVES</h2>\n<p>The seabed and mangrove swamps off the shores of the Newlands are full of geologically active cracks — a consequence of the heavy bombardment during the Portal Wars, if one is to believe the Institute of Dogma. This condition causes underwater earthquakes at regular intervals, which usually manifest as a ripple in the ground or on the floating platforms. These disturbances sometimes last for weeks, in a phenomenon colloquially known as “The Dancer's Yourba” after a dance of the same name.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, major earthquakes trigger the formation of large tidal waves that flood several of the larger cities along the coast. This has led to the construction of drainage channels, wave walls, and special wave fields – powerful electromagnetic discharge systems that slow down the waves.</p>\n<h2>THE NIGHTSTORM</h2>\n<p>Old folktales say that in the darkest nights when the air over Shimush is otherwise still, the Nightstorm blows. This rare, ethereal storm is felt viscerally by self-proclaimed prophets and seers, who experience high fevers and sweating. Even ordinary people can be affected when the silent storm rages — suffering from headaches, nightmares, and sometimes even nosebleeds.</p>\n<p>During the Nightstorm, it’s said that djinn, spirits, and other dark beings rise and walk on Sadaal's surface. People out at night can be lured away, never to be seen again. Reportedly, even entire villages have disappeared without a trace during a Nightstorm: Over the course of a single night, a village on the site now occupied by the City of the Whisperer in Alburz became a ghost town after a Nightstorm passed through it.</p>\n<p>Not everyone believes this explanation, however. Some Sadaalians say the disappearances were actually the work of a secret police force, carrying out a purge to make room for the newly-built Consortium district.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"5u6rccRKWrdC48qP","name":"10 - Locations in the City","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE CITY</h1>\n<p>Alburz is as strictly constructed as the Icons in Sadaal. In its original form, the available area for the city was used extremely efficiently, with no space wasted. But this does not mean the city feels cramped. Instead, one senses that even large open spaces in Alburz have a place and a purpose.</p>\n<p>Several institutes are responsible for urban planning. They ensure the city's original aesthetics are not destroyed by any novelties. To even add an extra window into a home requires visits to several agencies and an endless stream of forms and paperwork that must be completed and approved. This does not apply to construction in the City of the Whisperer, over which the Alburz bureaucracy has no influence.</p>\n<h2>THE STEAM BATHS</h2>\n<p>The steam baths are a social hub for the citizens of Alburz. The baths are surrounded by restaurants and arcades, where visitors can do anything from play a game of nardshir to compete in athletic competitions involving riding and axe throwing. The baths and everything around them are open around the clock, every day of the cycle. The baths themselves are spectacular chambers adorned with mosaics and precious metals.</p>\n<p>It is obvious that a lot of time and money has been invested on both building and decorating the baths. But like most things on Sadaal, the baths are not lavish: They are beautiful but discreet. The baths are used by everyone. Families with children will make a full-day visit, including food and entertainment. Officials and priests often use the baths as a place for informal or unofficial meetings. For those who are cunning, there is the opportunity to hear many secrets being discussed in the smaller steam chambers.</p>\n<h2>THE HANGING GARDENS</h2>\n<p>Alburz is known throughout the Horizon for its hanging gardens. The Ziggurat of the Icons in the center of the city is covered in fantastic cultivation terraces, used to grow crops and ornamental plants from across the system. The ziggurat is surrounded by orchards of fruit-bearing trees native to the system but similar to the cherry trees of AlArdha. When these flower in spring, the square is covered in a carpet of blue petals.</p>\n<p>During the harvest festival known as Urvatat Khari, both city dwellers and Iconocrats are invited to gather and enjoy crops grown on the ziggurat during the year. In reality, however, it is mostly Iconocrats who partake, with only a few of the city's residents benefitting.</p>\n<h2>THE PLAZA OF THE PROPHETS</h2>\n<p>The Plaza of the Prophets is a large octagonal space in the center of Alburz. Its sides are lined with long walls carved with words of wisdom from Aremerat and the Amesha Spenta. Prophecies and laws, texts with religious and secular meanings, everything that the Iconocrats have pronounced and prosecuted since the Portal Wars – all is preserved here. As the stones that make up the walls crumble, they are removed and replaced with fresh ones. The old ones are taken to the museum under the plaza where they are preserved and can be viewed by the citizens.</p>\n<p>The plaza is in many ways the very essence of Sadaal. The traditions, the history, the Aremerat, the eternal dutiful work in the name of the Icons – all of this comes together in this place. The Plaza of the Prophets is therefore often very quiet, despite the large crowds that are found in it most days. There is a sense of reverence throughout the area.</p>\n<h2>THE SERVANTS OF THE SEER</h2>\n<p>In the Plaza of the Prophets move the Servants of the Seer, called Kavi. Citizens get a prediction for some coins. Most often, the Servants are deceivers in the service of the Iconocrats, who utter prophecies that are consistent with the views of the Amesha Spenta. With the awakening of the mystics, \"real\" Kavi have also appeared, and suddenly real prophecies are spoken in the plaza. Genuine Kavi who are not careful are quickly taken away by the Phantoms of the Whisperer.</p>\n<h2>THE WORLD BELOW ALBURZ</h2>\n<p>Under Alburz there is a whole system of caves, tunnels, and halls. But it is not a hidden place where the shady elements of society thrive. It is as much a part of the city as the buildings above ground. The caves are used for industrial, commercial, and residential purposes. Everything is centered around a popular steam bath known as Pheri’s.</p>\n<h2>THE SCREAMING ZIGGURAT</h2>\n<p>The Amesha Spenta often removes troublemakers and criminals in silence, or quickly and mercilessly with the blades of the Phantoms of the Whisperer. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to set an example.</p>\n<p>The tool for this is The Screaming Ziggurat. This building is located in central Alburz, surrounded by Cherry Plaza. Public executions are held on the ziggurat, and criminals are severely punished in the plaza. Political prisoners are held in the depths of the building and tortured. Sometimes their tormented screams are broadcast in the plaza via a loudspeaker system.</p>\n<p>On one long side of the plaza is a heavily guarded building with a single fortified balcony high up on the wall facing the plaza. It is said that Aremerat himself views the most important punishments from there.</p>\n<h2>THE CITY OF THE WHISPERER</h2>\n<p>The only new district in Alburz is Nystaden, or the City of the Whisperer as it is called by native Sadaalians. One night, the people who lived in this district disappeared as if by magic. Their fate remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>In the days that followed, the Consortium's construction ships arrived and built a number of structures in the district. Although they follow the general style of architecture in Alburz, the Consortium’s buildings are still seen as an insult by most city dwellers.</p>\n<p>Many bureaucrats and artisans work in the neighborhood. Unlike in the Newlands, masks are expected to be worn in this city, including by visitors from the Consortium companies and their holdings.</p>\n<h2>ABYSS SPACE PORT</h2>\n<p>In one of the valleys at the edge of Alburz, the Abyss Spaceport has been blasted directly out of the vertical rock wall. Large hangars open like the mouths of monsters to swallow approaching ships, while landing bridges protrude like tongues for smaller vessels to land on. Everywhere, the Institute of Protection's masked guards patrol, while flying reconnaissance drones fill the air – something that on several occasions has led to collisions.</p>\n<p>Larger ships do not fit in the Abyss: Instead, they must land in a wide valley below Alburz, where people and goods headed to the capital are loaded into shuttles, smaller hovercraft, or the train that spirals its way up the mountain.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"DlXxpjTY68xNCN7R","name":"01 - The Sadaal System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE SADAAL SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>Sadaal is a binary system. Sadaal-A, known as Sadaal, and Sadaal-B, or Bahram, each have one planet in their orbit with good conditions for human habitation, both of which are named for their respective stars. While the planet Sadaal is dominated by high mountain ranges and arid steppes, Bahram is covered by vast seas, inaccessible swamps, forests, and large areas of arable land.</p>\n<p>In recent cycles, the Consortium has been conducting small-scale mining in a minor asteroid belt in the Bahram system. The Consortium is also in ongoing negotiations with the Iconocrats to conduct prospecting expeditions on the moons orbiting the gas giant Buyasta. Apart from this, the system does not contain much of interest.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"Hkncu6ekBU5wNIqs","name":"06 - Travel in the Sadaal System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>TRAVEL IN THE SADAAL SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>The conditions for travel are very different between Sadaal and Bahram. On Sadaal, extensive railway systems connect the cities, the mines found in the Shimush range, and the slaughterhouse complex out on the plains. On Bahram, people often travel by boat or hovercraft — even inside the cities, most of which are built on islands or on platforms in the swamps. Atmospheric shuttles are also available, but rarely used by common citizens.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the means, efficiency in travel is the universal priority. Trains are always on time, and the shipping lanes are clearly planned and marked. Logistics technicians rub their pocket watches — talismans dedicated to the Dancer — and rejoice in every minute they can save in her name.</p>\n<h2>THE BAHRAM LOOP</h2>\n<p>Paradoxically, while the portals orbit Sadaal-A, the system’s largest space ports are on Bahram. The close in-system distances and complex orbits mean that there are typically no more than 50 AU between the outer edges of Sadaal-A and Sadaal-B, though they can reach almost 200 AU from each other at their furthest.</p>\n<p>As many ships are manufactured in the Daharab Shipyard on Bahram, the route connecting the systems — the Bahram Loop — is well-trafficked. A dozen specially built bulk carriers known as Aremerat’s Giants transport raw materials from Sadaal to Bahram via the Loop. Driven by antimatter rockets, these haulers can traverse the route in only three weeks if the suns are right. According to Aremerat, the rockets are a precious gift from the Icons themselves.</p>\n<h3>✺ AREMERAT’S GIFT</h3>\n<p>In the space between the orbits of Sadaal-A and Sadaal-B is the small space station Aremerat’s Gift. The purpose of the station is to illuminate the path for ships so they do not fall into the Darkness Between the Stars on their way between the systems. A miniature star orbits Aremerat’s Gift – an artefact of the early Firstcome settlers according to the Foundation's astrogators. But every Sadaal resident believes that this miniature star is actually another of Aremerat's eight wonders in the systems.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"QFKVaEDcQvhUROOu","name":"03 - Sadaal Today","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>SADAAL TODAY</h1>\n<p>Today, Sadaal is dominated by a cult of personality that has little in common with the Horizon's more widespread forms of Icon worship. The ruling patriarch Aremerat is portrayed as the Icon of the Icons, his deification taken to such extremes that he’s become labeled mockingly by the Bulletin as “the tenth Icon.” Sadaal is an insular system, where news from the rest of the Horizon is tightly censored, and emigration is forbidden. In recent cycles, the Consortium and other groups have been allowed to establish a modest presence, and many Sadaalians desperately hope for further relief from the rigid systems that control their lives.</p>\n<h2>AREMERAT</h2>\n<p>To the common man, the leader they see in the news broadcasts is the same Aremerat as their spiritual father, who founded the civilization in Sadaal after the Portal Wars. The process of appointing the Aremerat is unknown to everyone but the Amesha Spenta - the Eight Wisdoms, who are the only ones to meet him. Some believe that Aremerat is an exalted Amesha. Others claim that Aremerat has access to technology that allows him to extend his life by hundreds of years. For Sadaal's people, the answer is clear: Aremerat is immortal. He is eternal and will always hold his protective hand over the people.</p>\n<h2>THE EIGHT WISDOMS</h2>\n<p>The most powerful group in Sadaal is without question the Iconocrats in the Amesha Spenta, also known as the Eight Wisdoms. These high priests, or Ameshas, interpret Aremerat's words and are the de facto rulers of the system in all matters. Each of the eight Ameshas represents one Icon and is also the supreme leader of an institute that reflects the domain of that Icon, as it is understood in Sadaal. The ninth Icon, the Whisperer — known as the Faceless One elsewhere — has no representative in Amesha Spenta.</p>\n<p>The Ameshas work hard to stay in Aremerat's favor. They maneuver politically to maintain and expand their power base. Institutions, bureaus and ministries grow or shrink, priests gain or lose influence. Sometimes, outright assassinations take place. The scheming of the Ameshas is a constant shadow play that often takes a hard toll on the population.</p>\n<h2>THE INSTITUTE OF PROTECTION</h2>\n<p>One of the largest organizations in Sadaal is the Institute of Protection, which operates under the wisdom of Habathu, the Judge. Over the cycles, the Institute has expanded and is now largely autonomous. The Institute of Protection monitors the two systems and guards them from major internal and external threats. The Sadaal system's army and fleet, plus a number of important fortifications, fall under the Institute of Protection's mandate, as do many reconnaissance drones and satellites.</p>\n<p>The Institute of Protection employs drones, which patrol the avenues and thoroughfares of all major Sadaalian cities, as well as railway lines and shipping routes. Or, at least, that's the official truth. The reality is that a lack of spare parts and know-how has caused many drones to crash or suffer sensor malfunctions. Many residents have figured this out and now ignore all drones — or, at least, the older models.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Institute of Protection’s spacebased systems are better-serviced, and satellite networks provide reasonable but spotty coverage of fixed installations and colonies.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"WgsPrc2zBfK6eFaA","name":"05 - People and Culture","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h1>\n<p>Tradition is the key word in Sadaal's culture. People respect and preserve what has been. History is the most important subject taught, and everyone can list Aremerat's successes. It’s no wonder that many in the system have difficulty with change. Change happens slowly, whether it’s to introduce a new working method in agriculture or to adopt the latest fashions from Coriolis. \"This is what we have always done,\" mutter the Sadaal-born, “and I am happy with it.”</p>\n<p>For outsiders, craftspeople and their works are the ideas most closely associated with Sadaal. Masks and watches are the most famous creations from the artisans of Sadaal, but jewelry and talismans from Shaira's forges, and objects from the glassblowers in Dobrai, are also considered to be of the highest quality.</p>\n<h2>THE CITIZENS OF AREMERAT</h2>\n<p>The citizens of Sadaal usually live a structured, simple life, working to support their families. They carry their talismans with them and thank Aremerat at dawn and dusk for the civilization he has created. They meet their confessor at least once a week to scrutinize their actions, and meet their friends at the modest cafes in the parks and at the magnificent steam baths. There is no need left wanting for Sadaal's citizens, but there is also no abundance. Everything happens with moderation, and the people of Sadaal know no decadence.</p>\n<p>Life for citizens on Bahram is different. The increased trade and contact with the outside world has opened the eyes of many to the possibility that there is something better than a structured, predictable life. Farmers are moving to the cities to take part in the new economy. A middle class has emerged. In connection with shipyards and industries on Bahram, new neighborhoods are taking shape, influenced by architecture and culture from other worlds. These changes are also affecting the people. There’s less bigotry, and the citizens here are less afraid of change.</p>\n<p>Common to all citizens is a predilection for gambling and betting. Nardshir boards can be found in every home and later in the evenings, young and old alike sit in the lantern light around gaming tables in parks and outside restaurants. Virtually every city has sports arenas and racetracks of varying sizes. Outsiders say that the only time Sadaalians show genuine passion is when it’s time to bet their hardearned birr.</p>\n<h2>THE ICONS OF SADAAL</h2>\n<p>The way the Icons are interpreted in Sadaal is defined by the Iconocrats who rule over the system and how the rules they established shaped the population. Icon control is a way to keep the population in check.</p>\n<h3>✺ ERIOSANG, THE MESSENGER</h3>\n<p>Carries messages to the faithful. He also stands for the traditions that are passed on through the generations.</p>\n<h3>✺ VANZUR, THE DANCER</h3>\n<p>She brings inspiration to true believers.</p>\n<h3>✺ MATAY, THE SEER (THE GAMBLER)</h3>\n<p>The icon of uncertainty and chance.</p>\n<h3>✺ RAMAITI, THE SERVANT (THE DECKHAND)</h3>\n<p>The good-natured worker. He is dutiful to his superiors and never complains.</p>\n<h3>✺ URVATAT, THE GIVER (THE MERCHANT)</h3>\n<p>Always gives but only as much as you need, no more. He always receives what you do not need to give to others.</p>\n<h3>✺ HABATHU, THE JUDGE</h3>\n<p>The other Icons are also judged on his scales – all except Hakad, who stands outside of time and justice.</p>\n<h3>✺ MANAVOH, THE COUNSELOR (THE TRAVELER)</h3>\n<p>She always has good advice for those whose hearts are pure of faith.</p>\n<h3>✺ VOUKASHA, THE WEEPING WOMAN (THE LADY OF TEARS)</h3>\n<p>She protects the dead and dying.</p>\n<h3>✺ HAKAD, THE WHISPERER (THE FACELESS ONE).</h3>\n<p>He stands outside the other Icons. The Whisperer sees all the secrets believers carry in their hearts and gives them to Habathu to weigh on his scales.</p>\n<h2>BY THE SWEAT OF YOUR BROW</h2>\n<p>Temple cities dedicated to the Icon Ramaiti - the Servant, are located in the largely inaccessible foothills south of Shimush on Sadaal. Here, conscientious citizens devote their lives to honest work, secure in the conviction that they honor the Servant with every movement. Sadaalians speak in reverent tones about the temples. For many, the opportunity to work there is their most fervent wish.</p>\n<p>Recently, rumors are spreading that the temple cities are in fact labor camps for dissidents and insurgents – something that most Sadaalians do not believe.</p>\n<h2>A THOUSAND TONGUES</h2>\n<p>The Zeni language is rarely spoken in the Sadaal system. It is mainly in Bahram that Zeni – the lingua Franca of the Horizon – has begun to take hold. Sadaal’s indigenous languages remain prevalent in Alburz. Priests and diplomats claim they do not speak a word of Zeni and use indentured interpreters during meetings with outsiders. That said, there is no single language spoken throughout Sadaal. Even before the Portal Wars, many dialects were spoken. As societies disintegrated after the wars, the dialects drifted even further apart. Today, for example, the language of the mining communities in eastern Shimush has very little to do with the equivalent in the Newlands of Bahram.</p>\n<h2>THE MASKED PEOPLE</h2>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Portal Wars, violent sandstorms ravaged Sadaal. The population was forced to wear masks to be able to venture outdoors. From this, the mask became a symbol of the reconstruction of civilization.</p>\n<p>Skilled maskmakers enjoys a high status on Sadaal. Even priests will adapt to the maskmaker’s whims. This is especially true in the case of Gaubruva's daughters, six masters of the art, all descendants of the legendary Gaubruva. He is still, at the age of 97, a maskmaker for Amesha Spenta. There are collectors on Coriolis and Mira who will pay absurd sums for a real Gaubruva. Several graves in the Tombs of Saraosa have been looted in desperate attempts to find ancient masks. Grave robbers that are caught have been sent back to their patrons with tin masks riveted to their heads.</p>\n<p>Masks are a way to differentiate status on Sadaal. Priests and influential officials at the institutes wear full-face masks of bone, silver or stone, adorned with beautiful patterns, precious stones, and precious metals. Family heads often adhere to the tradition of wearing embroidered cloth masks while industrial workers will at least have a paper mask over their noses and mouths.</p>\n<p>In Bahram, masks in everyday life are seen as anachronistic – a relic of an outdated social order.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE DANCE OF THE MASKS</h3>\n<p>Two nights a cycle, all citizens don masks and take to the streets. They leave their identities at home and become different people. Lanterns, flags and symbols of the Icons decorate the cities. This is the only time of the cycle when the citizens of Sadaal and Bahram host parties and allow themselves to forget about laws and ordinances. The Dance of the Masks, as the nights are called, is encouraged by the Iconocrats as something for the population to look forward to throughout the cycle. The nights also provide the Institutes with excellent opportunities to remove problematic individuals under cover of the dance’s carnival atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>THE CLOCKMAKERS OF VANZUR</h2>\n<p>The horologists of Sadaal do not have the same status as the mask-makers, but they are still highly valued. Their creations honor Vanzur, the Dancer, also called the Mother of Time. Beautiful hourglasses, intricate pocket watches, astrolabes, giant pendulum clocks – no instrument for measuring time is beyond the skill of the clockmakers.</p>\n<p>Slim valve hydrate clocks are the highest fashion on Coriolis. Nowhere is the water clock made more beautiful than on Sadaal. In connection with the Consortium being allowed to establish itself more permanently in the Sadaal system, the Iconocrats have allowed a few clockmakers to leave the system. Some in the Amesha Spenta see it as an excellent opportunity to showcase Sadaalian culture and thus perhaps attract more external investment to the system.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"imkA9c6sQio6VHya","name":"04 - Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CONFLICTS</h1>\n<p>What defines Sadaal today is the conflict between the old and the new, between tradition and open-mindedness. Societal change in Sadaal has always been slow and controlled, a method that the Iconocrats now seem to have realized is unsustainable. One must make concessions if one is to be part of the Horizon — and prevent outright rebellion.</p>\n<h2>THE ARRIVAL OF THE CONSORTIUM</h2>\n<p>The Consortium has been given permission to build a base of operations in the Newlands, a group of islands on Bahram in Sadaal-B. Many Sadaalians see the Consortium's presence in the system as an insult. What are they doing there, if not depleting Sadaal's valuable natural resources?</p>\n<p>The Consortium was allowed to establish itself as the result of a power struggle amongst the Amesha Spenta.</p>\n<p>Amesha Eriosang, who oversees the Institute of Dogma and its many indoctrination programs, is outspokenly opposed to admitting outsiders. This is challenged by Amesha Manavoh and Amesha Vanzur, who have ensured the Consortium’s access to Sadaal. The outcome of this contest is still unclear.</p>\n<p>Naima Thaud, the Consortium's primary representative in the system, warily navigates this conflict. She has many Icon scholars among her staff who regularly meet with the local Iconocrats on Bahram. Over glasses of tea and matches of the backgammon-like game nardshir, the scholars and Iconocrats are carefully building goodwill and trust.</p>\n<p>Thaud is measured and thoughtful in both word and action, but she hopes to drive ever-greater wedges between the Ameshas over time. Mulhim Daro, her colleague and head of safety at the shipyards in Daharab, is far less subtle. If it were his choice, a Legion cruiser would rain death over the capital Alburz at the slightest provocation. He is in constant conflict with Thaud over how the Consortium's affairs should be handled.</p>\n<h2>THE LANTERN OF THE RIGHTEOUS</h2>\n<p>Discussions about the Icons and their role in society have never been a part of Sadaal's everyday life. The words of the Iconocrats are unquestionable truths, the very foundation of society. Over the last cycle, however, this has begun to change.</p>\n<p>Priests in Manavoh's deep red robes move about the workers' quarters in the evenings. They stop at tables in the alleys of the souks and talk to the men who have yet to return home after a hard day’s work in the grain mills and factories. They sit by the wells where the young people meet to play dice. Everywhere they appear, they initiate discussions about the Icons, Amesha Spenta, and events taking place across the Horizon. It's so easy to plant ideas in the minds of the tired and the young...</p>\n<p>This group calls itself the Lantern of the Righteous and believes that its light will guide the virtuous through the darkness that prevails in Sadaal. So far, the group has managed to escape the attention of the authorities. Speculation abounds as to who is behind the group and the actual purposes of its recruitment efforts. Could it be the Consortium that seeks to foment such a rift in the population? Or is it a sign of further power struggles within Amesha Spenta? Or is it some previously unknown group whose presence is now beginning to make itself felt?</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"q8jj6baUyvR8bn7W","name":"02 - The Icons' Chosen","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE ICONS’ CHOSEN</h1>\n<p>The first settlers in the Sadaal system were hardworking and practical. They carved temples and dwellings out of the massive Shimush mountain range, which runs parallel to Sadaal's equator and encircles the planet like a rosary. They built cities on the Bahram Archipelago and established large plantations along its fertile coasts. Sadaal was to be a glittering jewel in the Horizon, governed collectively by and for the people. The system flourished, and all were equal in the eyes of the Icons.</p>\n<p>The Portal Wars crushed all such idealistic thoughts. Sprawling sections of the Shimush were bombed, and terrible battles ravaged even the depths of its cave systems. Kinetic projectiles fired from orbiting battleships spawned huge tidal waves that swept over Bahram's cities. Their onceunited society fragmented, the people of Sadaal struggled against each other for survival, each group declaring themselves the Icons’ chosen.</p>\n<p>Then Aremerat stepped forward. A prophet of the Icons. A unifying voice in the chaos that brought all the inhabitants of Sadaal into the Icons’ true teachings. A leader whose word was the truth that eluded the people of Sadaal before the wars. Surrounded by his Iconocrats, Aremerat stood as the focal point around which Sadaal's two systems were rebuilt.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"tuCQxbkbvpgScmS5","name":"08 - Locations in the System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>For outsiders, most of the Sadaal system is a mystery. Visitors usually travel only to Bahram, the Newlands, various smaller space stations, or the City of the Whisperer in Alburz. Some prospectors and artifact hunters have attempted to explore the ruins on Bahram or parts of the Shimush mountain range. They are considered foolhardy and likely to disappear.</p>\n<h2>SHAR-SHIMUSH</h2>\n<p>In the northern parts of Sadaal, where the mountains of the Shimush transition to the ice fields of the pole, there lies an almost-forgotten mountain pass known as Shar-Shimush. Here, the foothills are broken by a deep fracture, as if the Icons themselves split it with an axe. Due to Shar-Shimush’s east-west orientation, it is usually cloaked in twilight or darkness. Light only touches the rock walls along the northern side of the pass, shining on an occasional research institute facility as well as Kargil Khan, a fortress built by the Institute of Protection.</p>\n<p>Still, the pass is unusually warm for its latitude. It’s said that at its bottom, there are large ravines and cracks overgrown with lush moss and giant mushrooms, and prowled by mysterious, monstrous insects. The Institute of Protection’s presence is explained by rumors that there may be openings into the Cave Dweller’s tunnels deep in Shar-Shimush.</p>\n<h2>THE CANDABOURI</h2>\n<p>The Candabouri – a rare freshwater swamp – is located adjacent to the artificial platforms and islands of the Newlands, a collection of islands on Bahram that the Amesha Spenta designated as a place for foreign companies to establish themselves. Urvatat Khoni, a large water treatment plant and pumping station, is located here. Named after the Icon known locally as Urvatat the Giver, the station was designed by engineers from the Consortium member company Exeter.</p>\n<p>The swamp is surrounded by grasslands subjected to seasonal flooding, making them ideal for the cultivation of rice and watermelons by local farmers. Unfortunately, this activity often leads to conflicts between the farmers and the amphibious humanites who call the swamp home.</p>\n<p>The Institute of Protection has carried out multiple purges and mass executions of the humanites, but they always return, leading the Amesha Spenta to begin considering options for a more permanent resolution.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE CITY OF SINDH-KUR</h3>\n<p>In the depths of the Candabouri can be found the partially flooded ruined city of Sindh-Kur. The city was not destroyed during the Portal Wars but as a result of one of the Dancer's tidal waves, which inundated Sindh-Kur shortly after it was built by the Colonial Agency: Sindh-Kur’s location was chosen for its fresh water supply, but the builders did not take the area’s low-lying topography into account.</p>\n<p>The ruins include a lot of technology from the time of the city’s construction, much of which now lies at the bottom of the swamp where it’s a tempting treasure for looters. When the Dancer’s Tidal Waves appear, the water rises high enough that the entire ruined city disappears below the surface. Nowadays, the Sindh-Kur is said to be haunted by amphibious humanites and the occasional djinn.</p>\n<h3>✺ MIRPUR’S GRAVES</h3>\n<p>Off the coast from the Candabouri on Bahram lie Mirpur’s Graves — three perfectly circular and utterly barren dead zones in the midst of the otherwise coral-rich seabed. The Institute of Protection has prohibited all travel to the graves, closing the area to fishing, transport, or exploration. There are no shipping lanes, no fishing platforms, and no shrimp farms here. The Institute has not released an official explanation, but many believe that each of Mirpur’s Graves is the last resting site of a missile that hit the sea during the Portal Wars but failed to detonate – thanks only to the care of the Icons.</p>\n<p>The humanites that live in the swamp and along the coast have legends that tell a different story. They believe the patches were caused when three fireballs – or, possibly, the humanites’ colonization ships – crashed into the sea in ancient times.</p>\n<h2>THE DAHARAB SHIPYARD</h2>\n<p>Located in the Newlands on Bahram, the Daharab shipyard is the Consortium's center of power in Sadaal. Several of the Consortium's companies have interests here, where they operate under a central management group — one of the Iconocrats’ many conditions for giving companies access to the islands.</p>\n<p>Churning out not only space vessels but seafaring ships as well, the Daharab shipyard's huge factories reach hundreds of meters into the air and can be seen from several kilometers away over open water. Sections of giant cargo ships are constructed here and then lifted by massive shuttles into orbit, where they are assembled. The Consortium hopes to use the ships constructed here to expand its trade in the Sadaal system.</p>\n<p>The Consortium constructed its sprawling factories on the shore of the Candabouri. To make room for additional manufacturing space, as well as provide housing and entertainment districts for the shipyard’s workers, the Consortium also built numerous artificial islands adjacent to the swamp – linked to each other and to the mainland by floating platforms.</p>\n<p>Now, Daharab is now a bustling metropolis, with a society much more stratified than in other parts of the planet and across the system. Far from the watchful eye of the Iconocrats, Daharab offers plenty of economic promise for the wealthy and ambitious. At the same time, many of its citizens live in poverty, something that is not largely known to exist in Alburz and other major cities in the Sadaal system.</p>\n<p>The presence of many mercenaries at Daharab is another visible indication that the Iconocrats’ control is weaker in the Newlands. As the Consortium and other organizations import labor from across the Horizon, these mercenaries only grow more numerous. It’s rumored that a group known as The Serpent sells slaves to less-scrupulous companies, a practice the Iconocrats are said to ignore. It is considered a small price to pay to keep the trade going.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE HIRAM SQUADRON</h3>\n<p>The Legion has a small presence in the Bahram system. War Captain Amira Chamoun-Kouri commands the Hiram Squadron, or the remnants of it. The once-great squadron today consists of only a cruiser, a destroyer, two torpedo ships, and a few troop ships and other small vessels that are heavily armed and armored. The squadron’s mission is to protect the Consortium's shipyard at Daharab and the route through the Darkness between Sadaal and Bahram.</p>\n<h2>BELETSER SPACE STATION</h2>\n<p>The Beletser space station orbits Buyasta, the Sadaal system's only gas giant, hidden from view in the shadow of Artum – one of the massive planet’s 23 moons. The Consortium company Tilides built this station in utmost secrecy on behalf of the Foundation. At first, the Iconocrats of Sadaal were completely unaware of the station, but the Institute of Protection's drone satellites soon discovered it. The resulting backroom diplomatic crisis was quickly resolved with a new agreement between the Consortium and the Iconocrats. The Colonial Agency's mining operations in the system exist largely to conceal the shipping of materials and personnel to and from Beletser.</p>\n<p>Beletser is staffed by archaeologists, information technicians, service personnel, and a small but heavily armed and extremely well-paid force from the Legion. The station’s main purpose is to plan and conduct surveys of Artum and other moons around Buyasta. During the Portal Wars, installations on Belester excavated and examined remains from the Portal Builders, an activity that the Foundation has now resumed. What the Foundation has found, if anything, is a well-kept secret. Outside the Sadaal system, very few people know of Beletser. </p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"zqmNNPqusq1X6ghH","name":"09 - Alburz","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>ALBURZ</h1>\n<p>Sadaal’s capital, Alburz, lies adjacent to the highest plateau in the Shimush mountain range. Alburz is one of the few places on Sadaal that remained untouched during the Portal Wars. The city is carved out of the rock and is considered an architectural masterpiece. Tall towers stretch to the sky. Wide thoroughfares stretch between massive ziggurats. Slender bridges span deep valleys. The valley sides are carved into a multitude of homes that benefit from the rock's natural coolness during the hottest days. It is a green city of tree-lined avenues, expansive cultivated terraces, and generous, rolling parks that offer sweeping views of the Shimush mountains.</p>\n<p>Alburz also extends deep inside the mountain. Below ground, textile factories and refineries for salt, spices, and vegetable oil have been hacked out of the rock. Even further down, treatment plants and huge facilities pump water and natural gas from the depths.</p>\n<p>The city is the system's administrative, spiritual, and financial hub. Several districts are entirely dedicated to agencies and institutes where tireless scribes and archivists work around the clock.</p>\n<h2>POLITICS, LAW AND ORDER</h2>\n<p>The Iconocrats control Sadaal from Alburz: This is a reality accepted by a large proportion of the inhabitants as something that is, has been, and always will be. The Amesha Spenta exercise both spiritual and secular power. A number of agencies and institutes operate under the Eight Wisdoms, and each is responsible for one aspect of life in the Sadaal system. Many outsiders who have tried to establish themselves in the system claim that bureaucracy is Sadaal's only Icon, and that its symbols are the bookkeepers' expressionless eyes and the countless stamps required on countless forms to get anything important done.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE DARE OF THE SCALE</h3>\n<p>Habathu the Judge is the Icon that currently holds the most power in Sadaal. The Custodians of the Scale is a branch of the Institute of Protection that oversees the courts, prisons, laws, and regulations. The legal system is often completely incomprehensible, but tends to be harsh and inflexible. For example, the penalty for smuggling in printed or digital news from outside the system is whipping and deportation. In the less-prosperous neighborhoods of cities across the system, one can encounter many beggars with sewn-together lips and severed feet – the punishment for being found guilty of telling lies about Aremerat.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE</h3>\n<p>Democracy is considered a strange concept by ordinary Sadaalians. Who should choose the rulers if not those who always govern the system on the right path? The Voice of the People is the institute that oversees the spiritual decrees and directives that inform the people about who governs and why. The Voice spreads the Amesha Spenta's words. The Voice tells the people how to behave and what to believe. Manavoh the Adviser is this institute’s Icon.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE PHANTOMS</h3>\n<p>The Icon known as the Whisperer (the Faceless One) has no place among the Amesha Spenta. Instead, the Whisperer works through Angra Mainyu, Sadaal's dreaded secret police, whose members are known as the Phantoms. The Phantoms operate outside all laws except one: to maintain Aremerat's rule. The Phantoms have dragged many dissidents from their dinner tables into the streets and executed them in front of the neighbors, completely without trial.</p>\n<p>No one is safe. Everyone looks over their shoulders. No one openly questions the actions of the Phantoms. They are said to have informants everywhere. There are also those who claim the Phantoms possess the same qualities as the Whisperer himself – that they can physically change shape and move completely unseen.</p>\n<p>The Phantoms are so named for several reasons, but mainly because no one knows who they are or where they have their headquarters. They are all unknown, unidentifiable. Anyone can be a Phantom. It’s said no one sees the face of a Phantom and survives.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
