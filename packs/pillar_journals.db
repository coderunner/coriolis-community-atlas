{"_id":"Bwuh407kbtyQuRr6","name":"03 - Powerful Groups","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>POWERFUL GROUPS</h1>\n<p>There are several Factions that are active within the Quadrant of the Pillar, as well as several internal organizations. These, and their interests, are described briefly below.</p>\n<h2>THE CONSORTIUM AND THE CARTEL</h2>\n<p>The Consortium is deeply invested in the future of the Quadrant. They constantly expand their influence through alliances, colonization and trade, outmaneuvering local rulers and replacing them with Consortium-friendly pawns. Several ringleaders and organizations have welcomed the presence of the Consortium, and chosen the path of birr to grow in power. Together they have formed a coalition that is collectively known as the Cartel - despite its negative connotations.</p>\n<p>Cartel cells exists in various forms in almost all of the systems within the Quadrant of the Pillar, and it continues to find new representatives in the fringe caliphates and colonies. But they are not unopposed, as resistance groups arise anywhere the Cartel grows in influence. This has resulted in several incidents and atrocities performed by members of the Cartel, who secretly receives military training from allies of the Consortium, specifically from the Legion.</p>\n<p>For the resistance groups of the Quadrant it rarely matters which of the Consortium-affiliated corporations they are facing. Whether it is Nyala, Xoar, Parr-Nestera or any of the other companies which try to corner the market, in the eyes of the people - they are all the lackeys of the Consortium.</p>\n<p>The Moguls of the Janhagir fleet have shown themselves to be sceptical of the Consortium's meddling in the old order of the Quadrant, without understanding underlying causes or situations. The Consortium, in return, has accused the Moguls of deliberately crippling the systems’ development by limiting trade in the regions of the Quadrant. The accusation — or insult — has caused some Moguls to long for the days of old, when all of the Horizon dreaded their fearful might.</p>\n<h3>✺ CARTEL CELLS</h3>\n<p>The Cartel is not a collective organization but instead functions as local cells directly under the command of the Consortium. To know which cartel is referred to, the name of the region where it resides serves as a prefix, such as the Ayuin Cartel on Ordana. How the different cartels are structured and operated varies immensely, but various positions of power within the local society are often controlled by high ranking members.</p>\n<h2>THE JANHAGIR FLEET</h2>\n<p>The fabled nomad fleet of the Mogul clans has functioned as the nervous system of the Quadrant for as long as anyone can remember. The fleet traverses the quadrant in battered old ships, relics from the Second Horizon, that has been upgraded and modified, resulting in a fantastic mixture of technologies and traditions.</p>\n<p>The Moguls cemented their claim to power directly after the Portal Wars, when they braved the ancient portal fields and managed to unravel their secrets. For decades, the Mogul merchants reigned supreme, but their sovereignty has come to an end with the arrival of the Consortium.</p>\n<p>The increased competition has led to tension in the Quadrant, but open clashes between the Consortium and heirs of Janhagir have so far been limited. Some of the lesser Mogul-clans, who cannot depend on ancient trade contracts, have more or less resorted to the same activities as the Corsairs of Altai. The Dark between the Stars seems to encroach as the Moguls prepare for the new age.</p>\n<h2>THE LEGION</h2>\n<p>The Legion’s long held ambivalence toward the constellation is rooted in an ancient treaty signed with the Alabaster Council and the Moguls of the Janhagir fleet. This treaty, signed before the arrival of the Zenithians, forbid the Legion’s military involvement in the quadrant. Recently, the treaty has begun to crack as the Legion provides material and training to the Cartel, effectively giving the Consortium a military force in the region.</p>\n<p>The Legion must tread carefully or risk awakening the hydra headed by the Mogul clans, the Corsairs of Altai, and other warlords in the sector. More importantly, the Quadrant’s proximity to Kua and Coriolis means that the faction could become the target of sabotage and attacks on its home turf, resulting in the Legion’s commander’s hesitating to pressure the Quadrant’s indigenous forces further.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE LOOPHOLE</h3>\n<p>According to the old accord, the Legion’s ships can, if they have deactivated their weapon systems, traverse the star systems of the Quadrant of the Pillar without being disturbed or forced to pay customs. The Consortium has used this loophole to accompany Legion ships, claiming that the Legion constitutes as military escorts to the Consortium's freighters. Not too long ago the Alabaster Council added an addendum to the contract that was found in the ancient info bank of the city of Marakanda: if convoys are performed with other ships than just the Legion’s, the Legion’s vessels must be twice the number of any escorted ships. There is no regulations regarding the size of the escort, however, which has resulted in consortium freighters being guarded by numerous smaller gunboats and frigates. This protracted legal conflict suits none of the involved parties and it's just a matter of time before there will be bloodshed.</p>\n<h2>THE CORSAIRS OF ALTAI AND THE ALABASTER COUNCIL</h2>\n<p>Khorsabad's corsairs are one of the most influential forces in the Quadrant of the Pillar. The rulers of the Corsairs call themselves the Alabaster Council and dictate what is acceptable and unacceptable within their home system Altai - and according to some, the whole of the Quadrant.</p>\n<p>Behind their defensive nimbus they rule unopposed and can issue letters of marque, which infuriates the Consortium. Older corsairs are mostly antagonistic towards the Consortium's presence in the star systems and argue that outsiders should learn to respect the old order of things and not dispute prevailing customs and traditions, while the younger generation so far only sees more opportunities for easy plundering.</p>\n<h2>THE AMBASSADORS OF NESREDDIN</h2>\n<p>Nesreddin — also known as the Slumbering prophet - and his ambassadors are a fundamental part of the Quadrant of the Pillar. Many argue that Nesreddin originally was a prominent member of the Circle of Seekers, other more imaginative rumors claim that he is the last survivor of the mythical Network. Whatever the case may be, the Slumbering prophet acts through his envoys for peace, unity and an end to hostilities between the many sovereignties of the star systems. The prophet himself is too old to leave the holy mountain Arjjat, situated on the moon Nihn in the Ordana B-system.</p>\n<p>Since the Circle of Seekers have devoted themselves to the ascetic internal journey and thus revoked their diplomatic commitments in the region, it has fallen on the shoulders of the prophet’s ambassadors to create order in an otherwise chaotic cosmos. Nasreddin’s ambassadors are looked upon with great respect wherever they appear in the Quadrant and their words carry weight in many conflicts. The only ones who refuse their council are the Consortium and the newly established Path of the Elders.</p>\n<h2>THE ORDER OF THE PARIAH</h2>\n<p>The Order of the Pariah has come to view the Quadrant of the Pillar as their second front against the Council of Factions and the heresy surrounding the Emissaries. Instead of trying to win over the system like their adversaries, the order has planted a number of sleeper cells throughout the Quadrant. One of their most renowned cells is the Acolytes of the Martyr, who have perpetrated attacks on the Consortium and the Cartel's endeavors on several occasions.</p>\n<p>The Order’ primary objective is to destabilize the region and, in doing so, strengthen the blockade of Zalos. As the unrest of the Quadrant increases, the Order grows in power.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Order found an unexpected ally in the Lotus Brothers, an ancient priesthood on the agricultural moon Karast in the Sivas system. The people on the moon adheres to an ancient tradition of Icon worship that is very similar to the fanatical dogmas of the Order of the Pariah. Among the Brotherhood, the Order of the Pariah is seen as guardians of the faith, and a bulwark against the Dark between the stars.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"MxR3dp28ZmdN22sk","name":"04 - Life in the Quadrant","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LIFE IN THE QUADRANT</h1>\n<p>For the ordinary settler, life in the Quadrant is a perpetual struggle for survival, whether it's against the harsh environments, rival colonists or predatory corsairs. The hardships of life have molded the settlers accordingly. The norm is suspicion towards outsiders and an unwillingness to form emotional bonds with those outside the closest family circle. </p>\n<h2>LAW AND ORDER</h2>\n<p>The harsh and unforgiving existence in the Quadrant has also affected the people’s view of justice, a mindset which may seem particularly strange to an outsider. The different ethnic groups once shared a common code, but after several waves of colonization, the law has been split into three branches: the Janhagir Codex, the Alabaster law and the Cartel charter. Each group can technically request the right to be judged by their own regulations, but it is rarely acknowledged. Bounty hunters are often employed to implement justice outside of the settlements, most commonly when it comes to capturing criminals.</p>\n<p>Bounty hunting is one of the more lucrative, albeit dangerous, professions one can have within the four star systems. On a local level, the law is generally upheld by contracted security forces, hired mercenaries or corrupt militias.</p>\n<h2>TRADITIONS</h2>\n<p>The worship of the Icons has a long history in the systems of the Quadrant, but here, it is accompanied by a local tradition - the worship of ancestors, or the so-called Venerated.</p>\n<p>These are considered to be lesser icons, and are raised from prominent members of local communities, such as industrious patriarchs, founders of settlements and skilled craftsmen. The title is not given lightly, and it usually takes several generations before a deceased person is accepted as a member of the Venerated. Almost all communities in the Quadrant have their own pantheon of ancestors, and visitors are expected to show reverence to local customs. The Icons are still held in the highest regard, and the Venerated are seen as intermediaries between the Icons and mankind.</p>\n<p>Offerings to the Venerated generally occurs when one wishes to accomplish something similar to that ancestor’s historical feats. Each community has a person in charge of remembrance, a so called Rhapsode, whose task it is to write down and recount the deeds of the local ancestors, fulfilling the role of both preacher, poet and historian.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE PATH OF THE ELDERS</h3>\n<p>The Path of the Elders is a splinter sect practicing an unorthodox version of ancestral worship, where the members are tasked to perform controversial acts of faith to rise above their fellows and attaining the title of Venerated.</p>\n<p>The sect believes that the final reckoning of the universe is at hand, and that the unworthy will be barred from joining their ancestors in the great beyond.</p>\n<p>The sect has been accused of harbouring a deliberately anti-intellectual rhetoric that appeals to the illiterate masses of the quadrant. It has even been outlawed in many areas, where they are depicted as crazed fanatics and aggressive slave abolitionists. Recently, the four Patriarchs controlling the sect have been divided regarding the recent discovery of Mystics, and there are whispers that the issue will be discussed during an upcoming synod.</p>\n<h2>THE SLAVES</h2>\n<p>Slavery has been a common sight in the Quadrant ever since the warlord Tang Gol crushed the kingdom of Marakanda in the Altai system. Today, becoming a slave is often the last resort for people who, in one way or another, have fallen on economic hardships and are unable to repay their debts.</p>\n<p>The corsairs of Altai are especially infamous for taking slaves, as well as kidnapping ship crews for ransom – a custom that still lives on and is practiced daily. The corsairs have realized that Zenithians are particularly fearful of kidnappings and that they will pay handsomely for the release of their kin, especially for those of noble descent.</p>\n<p>The Consortium has forbidden the Cartel from participating in the slave trade, which is seen as both odd and divergent by the natives of the Quadrant.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"afV94N81CU4cilMC","name":"02 - The Quadrant Today","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE QUADRANT TODAY</h1>\n<p>The four systems in the Quadrant of the Pillar may at first glance seem disparat, but visitors soon discover a myriad of similarities among the systems' many cultures. It’s more common for the people of the Quadrant to live dispersed in various smaller settlements than in larger colonies or cities, although in recent times there has been an increase in newfound colonies that are focused on industry, something that has increased the need for a more centralized lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The balance of power has historically been split between the Mogul clans of the Janhagir fleet, the Alabaster Council of Khorsabad and smaller, aspiring actors. But after the Zalos blockade, the systems of the Quadrant of the Pillar have caught the eye of the whole Horizon, as the Zenithians are keen on maintaining their vital trade route through the Quadrant to and from Mira.</p>\n<h2>THE WORLDS OF THE PORTAL BUILDERS</h2>\n<p>The Quadrant features an unusually large number of inhabitable worlds, and there are scientists within the Foundation who believe that the Portal Builders themselves must have been involved in the engineering of the systems. Some even argue that the Quadrant once was the heart of the Portal Builder civilization.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"cDFZWztp4alFtn6M","name":"05 - Travel in the Quadrant","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>TRAVEL IN THE QUADRANT</h1>\n<p>Few settlers in the Quadrant ever leave their homeworld, some never leave their own colony. Those who do leave usually fall in two categories; people of faith setting off on a pilgrimaria, or dreamers wanting to find their lot in the universe. Many sons and daughters from wealthy families see it as a rite of passage to journey around the four star systems before returning home, wiser and ready to govern their kin.</p>\n<p>The sometimes sparse traffic in the Quadrant has resulted in a tradition of travelling together, and it is common for groups to gather in spaceports and transit halls to travel together to another star system. To travel alone is seen as ominous and foolhardy, and lone travelers are often mistaken for criminals and troublemakers.</p>\n<p>Recent cycles have seen an increase of travel in the region, much thanks to free traders braving the route to Mira. People no longer have to wait for several cycles until the next arrival of the Janhagir fleet, and the Moguls are slowly losing business in favor of the free traders, who are able to provide services twice as fast and at half the rate. There are however sinister rumors of kidnappings that have occured when nobles send their offspring with unscrupulous free traders.</p>\n<h2>THE QUADRANT PILGRIMAGE</h2>\n<p>Pilgrimages to one of the Quadrant systems, and sometimes all four, are not uncommon. The greater voyages usually begin in the Altai system, followed by Sivas, Zhau and Ordana before returning to Altai. As there is no prevailing canon regarding holy sites shared by the different groups within the region, there are no set destinations, but some are more visited than others. The most frequently visited sites are the Tree of Life, Mount Arjjat, the Dome of Kacche, The pyramid of Naboassar, the Stair of Kensa and the bleeding preachers of Dariko.</p>\n<h2>TECHNOLOGY OF THE QUADRANT</h2>\n<p>The technological level in the Quadrant is generally of low quality. Few areas are able to provide the ordinary standards one might expect, coming from one of the core systems. The growing industrial city of Ayuin in the Ordana system is a notable exception, and yet the local technological level varies enormously from district to district.</p>\n<p>The same can be said of the Janhagir Fleet, which possesses exceptional knowledge and capabilities in repairing spaceships and installing poached and bought components, but can only produce very basic medical appliances.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"uQOBCQqJzXpopRlF","name":"01 - The Four Systems","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE FOUR SYSTEMS</h1>\n<p>The Quadrant of the Pillar consists of the four systems that reside along the newly established Odacon-route between Kua and Mira. These have since time immemorial been named Altai, Sivas, Ordana and Zhau.</p>\n<p>The name, The Quadrant of the Pillar, is said to have its origin in the ancient and long since abolished system of designation that the first colonists used. What the other quadrants were called are difficult to ascertain from the old records. The closest estimate is that the Quadrant of the Nightingale included Algol and her sister systems, that the Quadrant of the Magistrate included Zalos and Aiwaz and that the Quadrant of the Lotus consisted of the Dabaran, Uharu and Melik Systems, among others. There are however few, if any, who still uses these old designations.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
