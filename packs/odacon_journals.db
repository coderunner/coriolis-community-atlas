{"_id":"0RocOPRcLzUlk8Wy","name":"05 - People and Culture","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h1>\n<p>Odacon consists of three power groups: the factions who wants to seize the resources in the system, independent prospectors who have left their home systems for fame and fortune, and descendants of those who managed to escape out into space when the system was devastated.</p>\n<p>Since a majority of its inhabitants are shadowy individuals, one of the first social codes to adhere to is not to ask questions. A simple statement such as “Hey Rafiq, is that an Algolan accent?” is a direct breach of social protocol, and while such violations go unpunished in other systems, one can expect a drawn Vulcan Pistol in Odacon.</p>\n<p>While their insistence on being armed can be perceived as a bit strange to visitors, no Odacian will ask another to leave their weapon outside when going into a negotiation. On the contrary, many people here would distrust a negotiating partner who comes unarmed, either for being too naïve or suspected of having another ace up their cassock sleeve.</p>\n<h2>ODACIAN FASHION</h2>\n<p>Apart from the weapons they always bear, there is a clear distinction between Odacians and others in the eclectic mix of clothing they wear. Clothes are either inherited, taken as loot, or brought by foreigners from their home systems. It is not unusual to see people pairing a Miran kameez with a furcoated cassock from the Quadrant of the Pillar together with a turban from Dabaran. Since Odacians live in environments where exos are worn at all times, it is common for people to wear kaftans, mantles and shemaghs over their exosuits. Shemaghs in particular have become more popular as shady activities have increased in the system. Another common affectation is the ascot, a traditional accessory for Odacians dating back to ancient times.</p>\n<h2>DICE AND DESTINY</h2>\n<p>There are other ways that the influence of pre-war Odacon has survived. One of them, is the deep abiding faith in destiny shared by those who live their lives in the shadow of Odacon's dying sun. It is not uncommon for crews to cast lots when making important decisions, especially when there is conflict between equals. The mere act of tossing a coin or casting a chance cube is held in the same regard as a democratic process, and is often seen as a fairer choice.</p>\n<h2>RELICS OF THE PAST</h2>\n<p>It is important to note that Odacian culture originates from a lost world. Every item salvaged from the remains of the now disintegrated planet Matush is considered highly valuable. Those who can afford it adorn their ships with these priceless finds, such as cabinets, carpets, and porcelain that once decorated living modules on Odacon. There is a habit among the richest captains in the system to offer drinks in cracked cups and refer their guests to worn divans. If the guest is insulted, it would most likely end in bloodshed, as failures to recognize Odacian culture most often do.</p>\n<h2>ODAC-WALI</h2>\n<p>In order to survive in the harsh environment of Odacon, it's people adhere to a code referred to as Odac-Wali, or the ‘Castaway Custom’. After the planet was torn apart, the custom arose within the groups of survivors that managed to escape into the darkness of space, yet even corsairs adhere to this custom to this day. Adherents of Odac-Wali promise to show hospitality to others who follow the custom, to help those who have been stranded, to resolve conflicts with casting lots or fighting duels, and to swear to exact cruel vengeance to those who violate the Odac-Wali.</p>\n<p>In the system there is also a strong belief in contracts. As soon as a contract is concluded, a copy of it is sent into space, either in the form of paper in vacuum-tight containers or transmitter buoys that send out the contents of the contract to unknown recipients. This is done because the residents of Odacon think that fate should be able to ensure that the contract is brought forward and make it known if the contract has been broken.</p>\n<h2>ODACIAN FOOD</h2>\n<p>Sadly, there is little to say about Odacian culinary customs. Most people live off a poor selection of various grown or plundered food. Most diets consist of freeze-dried ready meals purchased in bulk from Algol, or bio sculted algae grown in ship-board hydroponics. The only genuine Odacian food that survived is a fermented and spicy broth that is heated in samovars, often replacing both chai and kawah during both negotiations and feasts.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"Bp9ZWwbbdXjcrcQU","name":"04 - Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CONFLICTS</h1>\n<p>There is no central authority in the Odacon system to intervene in violent conflicts, but the different factions host smaller armed forces of their own. A tense calmness prevails throughout Odacon, since an important leg of the Miran chain trade route crosses through the system. The larger factions cannot tolerate dominance from any other faction or let the situation slide into total anarchy, which gives birth to an uneasy balance between them.</p>\n<h2>FREE TRADER CAPTAINS</h2>\n<p>The Free League holds some influence in the system, since the bulk of the trade between settlements and space stations is operated by free trader captains. The contracts for these trade routes seldomly attract men and women with good reputations, but rather captains on the verge of turning to piracy or becoming corsairs. Nonetheless, the Free League is a major contract giver for the many prospectors who search for treasures in the Ash Belt or under the frozen soil of Qayna.</p>\n<h2>THE AMBASSADORS</h2>\n<p>All the factions of the Horizon have sent an ambassador to the portal station of Khôban to counter the economic dominance that the Free League would otherwise enjoy if left unopposed in the system. The ambassadors meet regularly to discuss matters of importance, such as derelict claims and corsair incursions. In general, the meetings are a courteous discussion of matters over a meal and refreshments, but lately, heated arguments have sprung up between the Hegemony ambassador Tahisha En and the Draconite Rahman Hudda.</p>\n<p>The Draconites are very keen to keep the other factions away from the planet Rusah, a fact that Tahisha En has been quick to exploit as a way to break the monotony on the station. She publicly hires free traders and explorers to survey the planet and its moons, only to have the expeditions return empty handed after being forced to turn around by Draconite warships.</p>\n<h2>DREAMS OF THE ASH BELT</h2>\n<p>Thousands of prospectors, salvagers, and fortune seekers flock to Odacon, driven by the widespread rumours of archaic treasures hidden in the Ash Belt. Small-scale conflicts erupt regularly as crews vie for control over salvage, and whenever they escalate, they’re usually settled by the faction with the most warships present. The Order of the Pariah’s cruiser ‘The Punisher’ dominates the sector around Qayna and can deploy rapidly with its unique antimatter drive.</p>\n<h2>THE TREASURES OF SETHLAN</h2>\n<p>The planet Sethlan is closest to Odacon, the dark red star in the system. Sethlan is tormented with radioactive sandstorms and constantly shimmers with heat. The core has a particular high density and is sought after for its valuable minerals. The storms, the heat, and the extreme gravity make only the most daring and well-equipped prospectors consider working there. These obstacles have not prevented the Colonial Agency or the Order of the Pariah from establishing mining operations on the planet. The Order of the Pariah has thus far been more successful, relying on animated bionic constructs instead of human labor. Independent actors know to stay away from both the operations of the Order of the Pariah and the Colonial Agency.</p>\n<h2>BLADES OF THE CORSAIRS</h2>\n<p>Several bands of ferocious corsairs are said to be present in the Odacon system, and there are several reports of heavily armed ships that have boarded and looted prospectors and free traders. More sinister stories tell about pirates who not only loot the cargo, but also take the crew as captives and sell them to Algolan slavers.</p>\n<p>The most infamous corsair is Assal Isik, whose ship Dahaka brings terror wherever it goes. The Consortium have offered a great bounty to anyone who can stop the ravages of Isik. There have been a few close calls, but no one has yet succeeded in putting an end to the corsairs as the Dahaka is known to maneuver into the Belt of Ashes, disappearing among the debris.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"XtCFVYAGnQEZaw9f","name":"07 - Odacian Phenomena","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>ODACIAN PHENOMENA</h1>\n<p>Odacon is one of the most dangerous systems in the Third Horizon. Numerous ships and crews have perished in the vast darkness of the system.</p>\n<h2>THE BANE OF ASHES</h2>\n<p>The mention of the Bane of Ashes sends chills down the spines of the inhabitants of Odacon. It is an entity that is said to destroy ships by utterly breaking down their molecular structure. Some say it is a semi-intelligent war machine, while others claim it is a chaotic cloud of nanite robots. Others claim that it is just a hyper ionized cloud of ashes, sticking to the hull of the ships that encounter it, making their systems and sensors go haywire until they collapse completely. The truth about the Bane has yet to be revealed.</p>\n<h2>REMNANTS FROM ANCIENT TIMES</h2>\n<p>Strange and mystical artifacts from Odacon are sold throughout the Horizon, items stemming from prominent eras of the Horizon’s history or relics said to come from ancient alien civilizations. Those who search within the Ash Belt or the ruins of Qayna can find fist-sized dodecahedrons made of an unidentifiable metal with recessed sockets on one side. With the right equipment, it is possible to connect these artifacts to a tabula or a terminal and view memories stored within them.</p>\n<p>Most of these memories are just fragments and flickering images and have limited monetary value. Many memories are from the war, but there are rumors of far more interesting content. Some scavengers tell of people that have found schematics for the strange glyph armor that the Order of the Pariah builds, while others claim to have found maps showing the locations of lost portals. Others claim they have found remnants and ruins of the Portal Builders, twisted mental labyrinths where one can find revelation as well as madness.</p>\n<p>Among the rich and daring, certain memory-artifacts are especially sought after: those that contain memories of terrified and dying people from the large battles in the Odacon system at the end of the Portal Wars. Groups of nobles (and others with the right connections) recreationally access these artifacts and share these terrible memories. It is seen by many as the ultimate ecstasy, but it’s not without risks. Mumbling wrecks of men and women who have had their minds shattered by the horrific experience remain locked up in dark - and secured - chambers.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"eBaBXI9KXkgZR4rF","name":"08 - Locations in the System","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>Despite its isolation, Odacon's system contains several mythical sites such as the Ash Belt, the frozen planet of Rusah and the ship cemetery of Admiral Ghon Mirtzah.</p>\n<h2>A TORMENTED STAR</h2>\n<p>The star Odacon is said to have been used as a weapon in the conflict. Persistent rumors claim that a massive structure was built using long lost technology and that it was used to harness the power of the star. Matter from the star is said to have been ejected out in the system, burning away the atmosphere of the planet Rusah. Stubborn fortune seekers still search for remnants of this mythical technology inside the Ash Belt, as well as on the broken surface of Sethlan. To this day, the star is unstable and difficult to predict. It has cooled considerably and creates strange gravitational phenomena in the system. Theories about how its life cycle has been distorted vary greatly.</p>\n<h2>THE PORTAL STATION KHÔBAN</h2>\n<p>Odacon's administrative center, if one can be said to exist at all, is the portal station Khôban. It is an almost randomly assembled series of modules, old ships and all sorts of angular structures, which are constantly being rebuilt and expanded. The station is home to around 500 people, all of whom live in the outer layers of the station while the internal modules slowly decay. It is said that a group of slumdwellers still live in the station's aged and labyrinthine interior, but no one knows for sure who they are or how many they would be.</p>\n<p>Former free trader captain Akbar Dagoz is the station manager at Khôban. Dagoz is a very sharp administrator with a reputation of being hard but fair. Public order at the station is maintained by Judicars from Coriolis, who are formally under Dagoz command. Martyr warriors protect the envoy of the Order of the Pariah, Inashar Delion, and a detachment of Legionnaires protect the interests of the Consortium. The hub of the station is made up of the offices of the Colonial Agency, where prospectors, scouts, nomads and ash trawler captains do their business or quench their thirst in the cantina.</p>\n<h2>THE MINING STATION ECHRON</h2>\n<p>In low orbit around Sethlan lies the mining station Echron, a several kilometers-long and a few hundred meters-wide tube-shaped construction. A giant mass accelerator runs along its entire length. It is a remnant from the Portal Wars when it was used as a launch pad for massive kinetic projectiles, designed to inflict enormous damage on astronomical bodies.</p>\n<p>Nowadays Echron serves a very different - but still important - purpose. Given Sethlan's extreme gravity, it is very demanding for heavy freighters to lift the ore unearthed on both the planet and its moons. Instead, it is transported with simple cargo shuttles - essentially platforms with graviton projectors - to Echron. Once there, the ore isloaded into the mass accelerator and then shot out towards waiting freighters in high orbit. The station is kept in its low orbit by powerful thrusters salvaged from the Ash Belt.</p>\n<p>Because the station is so important, it must be operated by an independent party in order to avoid conflict between the major factions. The choice fell on Tobar Khan, brother of Baris Khan, the chief of operations of the Network in the Kua system. The Khan brothers are hardline men who swear allegiance to anything but commerce in the Horizon. Tobar has many workers under him, a jumble from all over the Horizon that have come to Odacon for various reasons, and found honest work on Echron.</p>\n<h2>RUSAH - THE EXECUTIONER'S ABODE</h2>\n<p>Beyond Sethlan is Rusah, now a completely lifeless planetary body with no atmosphere and seemingly nothing of interest. Whispers in dark corners of the cantinas on Coriolis claim that Rusah houses the headquarters of the Draconites, built on remnants from the Portal Builders and full of ancient secrets. The Draconites themselves do not comment on this matter. There are those who believe that even the system's most violent pirates stay off the planet for fear of what might happen to those who invoke the Draconites ire.</p>\n<h2>THE ASH BELT</h2>\n<p>Beyond Rusah, the vast Ash Belt spreads out like a dark veil. It consists of the remains of the planet Matush that was torn apart during the portal wars, as well as the wreckages of the fleets of the Firstcome, Al-ardha and the Second Horizon. The belt is a veritable gold mine for scrap prospectors and adventurers, but it also houses many dangers. In addition to the fabled Bane of Ashes, there are also bloodthirsty corsairs, automated weapon systems and forgotten mines. Several smaller asteroid and space station communities have been established in the inner sector of the Ash Belt. These serve as temporary housing for those who explore the belt, but they do not always provide ample protection. Karim Kish, a drunken loader, and infamous storyteller, is happy to share stories to curious travelers about the torn space station his former captain discovered where the entire crew was mummified and preserved in their moment of death. Most people blame the Bane of Ashes. Kish has other theories, which vary as wildly and exponentially as the degree of his intoxication.</p>\n<h2>THE GLACIER RUINS OF QAYNA</h2>\n<p>The planet farthest from Odacon’s star is Qayna, a frozen wasteland. The planet used to be densely populated and highly industrialized before the war, and while it was spared serious bombardment, the destruction of Matush and the birth of the Ash Belt has turned the planet into a cold and barren graveyard. Many structures have survived relatively intact, but the ice-covered surface makes them difficult to reach - something that hasn’t deterred brash prospectors from mounting ambitious expeditions to the planet. Recently, a group of free captains joined forces and excavated a giant, quarry-like pit deep into the ice. A considerable number of buildings have been unearthed, and massive mining drills have been flown in to expand the excavation. As more and more people are flocking here by the day, it is only a matter of time before the surface becomes too crowded and conflicts arise. </p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
