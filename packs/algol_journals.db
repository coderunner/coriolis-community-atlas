{"_id":"3nVIvE45aMEtr64j","name":"06 - The Planet Algol","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>THE PLANET ALGOL</h1>\n<p>The planet Algol is the hub of the system and where the major population centers are located. Most people, city dwellers and rebels alike, live in the planet’s two temperate bands. The planet’s habitable zones are crowded by cities both old and new – including Yasul, Akhandar-O-Sharif, Belem, and Yousfana. These are surrounded by widespread wastelands. Colonies and mining operations exist across the entire planet and are common throughout the system – including on moons and asteroids, and in the Cloud Belt.</p>\n<h2>THE TANZIM HIGHLANDS</h2>\n<p>North of the arid Mengol Sea, a volcanic massif spreads out. For the most part, this is an inhospitable plateau: In some places, the mountains of this range rise above the atmosphere. As such, the plateau would work well as a bridge to orbit – a natural beanstalk to the skies. So when the Consortium and the Zenithians arrived, they immediately began building a cable car system from Akhandar to the top of what is known as the Rhaas-Tanzim.</p>\n<p>The system was ready in record time but Yihanna and the rebels who were based in the mountains immediately began a campaign of sabotage, making the cable car impossible to use. The old space port on Rhaas-Tanzim is now a deserted town visited only by looters and reconnaissance drones from the Legion cruiser Gevennon-Parras. The massif is now partly rebel-controlled, and is rumored to be home to Slavers’ headquarters and opor farms.</p>\n<h3>✺ “SUBSTANCE O”</h3>\n<p>The opor cartel Yar-Figri has long controlled the fields used to grow opor poppy and black hellebore on the plateaus of the Tanzim highlands. The poppies are picked by slaves or unskilled workers, then processed into opor aboard mobile refineries built in old, repurposed free traders. This is then sold in the big cities or exported across the Horizon. Algol opor goes by many names, such as \"Demon's Eye\", \"Smoke of Freedom\" and \"Bright Star\".</p>\n<p>Recently, a new type of opor has also begun to spread, notably in the entertainment districts of AYM. This highly addictive variant is known as “Substance O”, as users often express an expectant “O” at the first hit. It is not known who developed the drug, but it is rumored that purges have taken place within Yar-Figri, which indicates a new player may be present.</p>\n<h2>MENGOL’S MINING ARCHIPELAGO</h2>\n<p>The saltwater Mengol Sea was once a place full of life, where fishermen lived along silvery white beaches and AkhandarO-Sharif reigned like a pearl on the southern shore. That all changed when the Consortium and the Zenithians arrived. The seabed was rich in nodules of almost pure metals, but harvesting those nodules using submarines and divers was expensive and difficult.</p>\n<p>The now-cursed engineer Yim-Ar Salbara pointed out to the Colonial Agency's akbars that mining could be facilitated by blowing up a rocky tongue separating the low-lying and arid Yafsa Desert from the sea. The sea would drain and the fishermen would be without jobs, but they could be employed as laborers in the new, open mines. With a little luck, the Yafsa Desert could also flourish.</p>\n<p>With profit in mind and dreams of an endless stream of birr, the project was launched under the name \"The Salbara Miracle\". Engineers easily blasted away the headland using strategically placed antimatter charges, which the Colonial Agency acquired under suspicious circumstances. In a month or so, all the water had run onto the sand: The Mengol Sea was drained and dried out quickly, while the Yafsa Desert turned into a lifeless salt marsh.</p>\n<p>Today, “salbara” is a curse word in the area, and Mengol's seabed is a parched plain dotted with mining units, dried up salt lakes, and shantytowns where the laborers who work the salt and mining operations live in misery. The shantytowns are a breeding ground for rebels, and attacks on mining drones, gigantic excavators, and the outskirts of AYM itself are now part of everyday life for people living on the seabed.</p>\n<h2>THE YAFSA STEPPE</h2>\n<p>Towards the South Pole, the salt marsh Yafsa turns into a frozen wasteland. This vast steppe is frozen all year round but also rich in deposits of natural gases and precious metals. The harsh climate and inaccessibility mean that major companies have eschewed it in favor of other, more lucrative sites. But hardy, independent miners can eke out a life here. It’s a solitary existence, where one shelters in a frozen outpost or perishes in one of the many snowstorms.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"6UejYCugCyH1dOwV","name":"10 - Akhandar-O-Sharif","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>AKHANDAR-O-SHARIF</h1>\n<p>Akhandar-O-Sharif is one of the oldest cities on the planet Algol – although it doesn’t look the part as much of the city was destroyed in the years following The Age of Flaming Tears. When Slavers blew up the Algolan Church of Sharmadom, most of the city's inhabitants fled. When the Zenithians arrived, they found mostly ruins around a dying city center and a decrepit harbor.</p>\n<p>This suited the Consortium and the other large companies just fine. Demolition and large-scale construction started immediately and today it is almost impossible to see that there was once a ruined city here. The new buildings were built directly on top of the old ones, or on platforms built above the ruins when that was more economical. Cloud towers, spires, Dabaran dome complexes, and the recentlyfinished Crater Cathedral have given the city a completely different look. Only in the poorer districts and shantytowns do ruins from the past stand out, as if pointing an accusing finger at those who would forget the past.</p>\n<p>Today, Akhandar (as it is more commonly called) has spread and merged with the other big cities on the southern shore of the Mengol Sea to form the gigantic metropolis known as AYM. This is almost comparable in size to the Conglomerate on Kua.</p>\n<h2>POLITICS, LAW AND ORDER</h2>\n<p>If there is one place in the Horizon that is governed in the same way as Coriolis and Kua, it is Akhandar. The Zenithian factions, led by the Consortium and the Zenithian Hegemony and backed by other large corporations, today support the entire Akhandar community – just as they do on the rest of Algol. This oligarchy differs in one important respect from Coriolis: There are no channels for popular representation. It is only through the benevolence of these companies that a social safety net exists.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE KHASARS</h3>\n<p>The leaders and entourages of the largest governing corporations gather once a month in the Zenith Palace, located in the city's central district of Khasa. The palace is a monumental building in the whitest marble, built by the Consortium and the Hegemony when the modern city was newly founded. Today it houses the city's central bureaucracy. Here, the war against the rebels is coordinated, decisions on the distribution of the districts are taken, and negotiations on major bribes are conducted. The district has given its name to the city's governing council, the Khasars.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE COMPANY POLICE</h3>\n<p>Order in the city is maintained by various company-controlled police forces. These go by different names depending on which district they belong to, such as the Khasa Guard, the Colonial Police and the Hyperion Granite Guards. The Consortium Guards is the largest unit and similar in organization to the Coriolis Guards. It is responsible for several districts, and provides security services to smaller companies – for a fee. Specific laws vary from district to district, as does the relationship between the police and the populace. In addition, there are laws that apply citywide – mostly related to rebel crimes, industrial espionage, and the like.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE REBEL HUNTERS</h3>\n<p>The companies have formed a collective military unit called the Rebel Hunters, and the Legion has trained its members in urban warfare. The Rebel Hunters’ job is to clear out the various rebel nests that grow like mushrooms in the shantytowns and The Undercity. It’s a mission with a high mortality rate, but compensation includes high salaries and access to the unit’s exclusive entertainment palace in the large Khorasan district. The Rebel Hunters are equipped with the very latest technology from the Consortium's arsenal – such as grav belts, combat gliders, and vomit fields.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"9LXf6zulxlarbTvG","name":"08 - Travel on Algol","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>TRAVEL ON ALGOL</h1>\n<p>Algolans only travel when they absolutely must. They prefer to stay in their cities, villages, and mining outposts. But when they do travel, there are a variety of options.</p>\n<p>In the cities that have been modernized by the corporations, there is everything from cable cars to rickshaws and privately owned grav taxis. Longer distances in the cities are covered by high-speed trains similar to those in the Conglomerate, while intra-atmospheric ships and spaceships serve the rich and powerful.</p>\n<p>In rural areas, people often travel via various crawler vehicles which often have some kind of exploration function. Caravans with wagons, grav trailers, dromedons (imported from Lubau) and elephants are also used for transport. The elephants were brought by the Firstcome colonizers and are available in every conceivable size: from the small, fast dwarf elephants that pull trucks on the outskirts of cities, to the woolly giants that the rebels train and use in the wilderness. In addition, elephants have also gone feral and large populations of wild elephants roam the warmer plains near the planet's equator.</p>\n<p>The Legion established a No Fly Zone over Haven and the entire Tanzim highlands after it became aware the rebels were smuggling weapons into the area and that they had access to spaceships with atmospheric capability. Mobile drone batteries and combat satellites deployed by GevennonParras patrol the skies to prevent flights, a situation that has irritated several corporations with operations in the area.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"IX274TWkhuOZa2E3","name":"07 - People and Culture","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h1>\n<p>The life of the Algolan people is rough. Whether they toil in the factories or in the mines and logging camps, their lot is one of hard labor. But just as the two suns Algol and Persei circle each other, the toils of the day alternate with the pleasures of the night. The big cities can compete in decadence with anything found on Coriolis or in the Cloud City on Dabaran. Entertainment districts known for their courtesan houses, as well as pit fights, grav racing, and other sporting events. Visitors can partake of countless types of kohôl, as well as opor, arrash, and a new drug, \"Substance O\".</p>\n<p>The countryside is at least as harsh on the people as life in the cities. Characterized by vast gravel deserts, empty tundra, forbidding mountain ranges and deep, dark forests, Algol seems designed to stop human progress. But this does not prevent settlers and companies from building mines or prospecting for precious metals. As the Algolan expression goes: “A miner in the morning can be a pasha by night.\" There are many who have succeeded and found great wealth. But just as many have lost fortunes to kohôl, arrash, or unfavorable contracts with the Colonial Agency.</p>\n<h2>TWIN SHADOWS</h2>\n<p>\"To be split like an Algolan\" is a phrase that has spread throughout the Third Horizon. The phrase refers to the phenomenon that all inhabitants on the planet have two shadows, cast by the system’s twin suns. This phenomenon seems to have spread to the Algolan’s way of looking at everyday life, as a dichotomy between hard work and excesses in entertainment.</p>\n<h2>THE PRAYER TOWERS</h2>\n<p>A famous architectural feature on Algol are the prayer towers which, since the time of the ancients, have been erected on the chapels and churches of the Icons. In the hands of the Zenithians, these have reached unimaginable height and splendor.</p>\n<p>In miniature format, the colorful prayer towers have become a popular prayer focus elsewhere in the Horizon, especially on Coriolis.</p>\n<p>Prayer is for the Algolans the most important of the Church of the Icons' nine sacred rites. All across the planet, society grinds to a halt as crowds gather to pray at dawn and dusk. Those who do not see prayer as important therefore usually stay inside during the early morning hours and when the evening shift begins.</p>\n<h2>DAY OF THE GOLD EATERS</h2>\n<p>A distorted Zenithian tradition that has spread from the Monolith to Algol is the Day of the Gold Eaters, when people feast on food and drink. To display their wealth and also receive the Merchant’s blessing, parts of the food are dressed in thin layers of gold leaf. Flakes of gold are also mixed in beverages. It’s believed that the more gold that is ingested, the more successful the Algolan will be.</p>\n<h2>BONFIRE NIGHT</h2>\n<p>On the last day of the Player's segment, the arrival of spring is celebrated with the bonfire, Charan, when the people light bonfires and jump over small fires. At the same time as celebrants jump over the fire, they chant the following rhyme:</p>\n<p><em>\"A great reprieve</em></p>\n<p><em>On Charan's Eve</em></p>\n<p><em>I burn my gown </em></p>\n<p><em>T</em><em>o sun retrieve\"</em></p>\n<p>The festival is celebrated with grilled lamb, dried fruit and nuts. Since the arrival of the Zenithians, the rebels have allowed the fire to gain even more significance, and arson attacks are often carried out on corporate buildings or interests during the night that follows.</p>\n<h2>MUSIC AND THEATER</h2>\n<p>The Algolan are a musical people. There are street musicians throughout the cities and in settlements across the planet. Often, they play one of the traditional wind instruments that are reminiscent of crooked and multi-pipe flutes. Before the Mengol Sea was drained, musicians also played on large shells, which today are rare and command incredible prices from collectors.</p>\n<p>Unlike the music, which tends to be happy, Algolan theater and festivals are gloomy affairs. Algolan tragedy is known all over the Horizon. Several actors, such as Omar Shiri and Amma dol-Haerric, launched their careers on Algol only to become famous throughout the Horizon via the Bulletin and the popular series, “The Plantation Owner's Daughter”. In the Khasa district of Akhandar-O-Sharif, the Mahumada Theater is considered a must-play venue for any self-respecting actor – preferably during one of the festivals in the city.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

Algol and Persei circle each other in a passionate dance while Rhaas, “The Forgotten Lover”, watches from afar. As the stars are white, only Algol-Persei space contains habitable worlds: Yavan, Algol, Ermenu, and Taus. A few worlds orbit Rhaas, 150 Astronomical Units from AlgolPersei, but these house only a handful of mining colonies.</p>\n<h3>✺ ALGOLAN ECLIPSES</h3>\n<p>Because the stars Algol and Persei rotate around each other at a distance of less than 1 Astronomical Unit, the entire system is centered around the two stars shining together on the planet Algol. During the day, both stars are visible in the sky as two suns that quickly change position in the sky. Every third day, a solar eclipse occurs when one of the stars passes behind the other and is eclipsed by its partner’s light. On rare occasions, both suns are eclipsed by Algol's moon Barir, and then only Rhaas shines faintly in the sky – an occurrence that heralds misfortune and death. The last time this happened was just before The Age of Flaming Tears. </p>\n<h2>LOCATIONS IN THE SYSTEM</h2>\n<h3>✺ RHAAS-MOHRA</h3>\n<p>The biggest mining station in the Rhaas system is RhaasMohra, located in the large asteroid belt that spans most of the system. Here, the Free League has joined forces with Hyperion (a member of the Consortium) to operate the mining station. Prospectors are recruited not only from Algol but from the entire Third Horizon, with those from Djachroum – in The Rimward Reach of the Kua system – in particular high demand.</p>\n<p>Rumors say the belt potentially holds remains from the time of the Portal Builders. This has led to a sharp increase in population in recent cycles and the station's life support system is now under great pressure.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE CLOUD BELT</h3>\n<p>A giant ring of space dust and gas known as the Cloud Belt occupies a band between the Algol system's three inner planets and the outer gas giant Taus. This is considered to be the beginning of what would have been the system's fifth planet, but for some reason the planetary evolution stopped.</p>\n<p>The Cloud Belt is in constant flux, and sometimes regions develop in the belt that are particularly rich in noble gases or metal ions. When that happens, the dust trawlers that patrol the area flock to harvest the wealth.</p>\n<p>Periodically, a dust trawler will dive too deep into a cloud and be unable to get out before the ship’s systems crash. Salvage ships that lie in wait nearby can then do good business when the cloud banks disperse. </p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"TMVDtqbgV6Z2rm8r","name":"01 - Of Mines and Minerals","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>OF MINES AND MINERALS</h1>\n<p>Algol is a system that has attracted people from across the Horizon. From wealthy citizens, to laborers living hand to mouth, to fugitives, many make their homes under its blackened sky. Algol is a system that once faintly resembled the Al-Ardha of legends – a coveted dream for the first colonists. Today, the activities of the Consortium and other companies have shattered the dream. The people of Algol are torn between loyalists and rebels, and the planet has suffered deep wounds from the progress of industry. It has become another version of the Al-Ardha that the Horizon's ancestors were forced to flee so many cycles ago.</p>\n<h2>CHILDREN OF THE DEMON STAR</h2>\n<p>Across the Third Horizon, Algol's reputation reflects its unspoken name: “The Demon Star”. It was thought to be a haunted place only visited by the desperate and the greedy. Those colonists were probably aware of the stories, but ignored the system’s bad reputation. Algol resembled the Al-Ardha they left behind, while their ship sensors indicated the system was home to rich concentrations of metals and minerals.</p>\n<p>Tradition names Algol as the first planet in the Horizon to be settled by the Firstcome. Algolans are proud of the status this confers, and take great umbrage at any suggestion – especially from “Mirans unfit to wipe down an elephant” – that Algol is not the cradle of civilization in the Third Horizon.</p>\n<p>The Firstcome settled in the temperate belts on the planet Algol. They quickly set to work, building several cities characterized by architectural wonders, sky towers, and even several iconic temples that are now surrounded by prayer towers.</p>\n<p>When the Portal Wars raged across the Horizon, Algol was hit hard. Many cities were destroyed during a campaign of orbital bombardments remembered today as “The Age of Flaming Tears.” In the aftermath, The Demon Star took back all that the people had received from it. Hunger, disease, civil war, and death followed and it was during this time that the now infamous Algolan Slavers first appeared.</p>\n<p>The arrival of the Zenithians on Algol revitalized the wounded world. Attracted by the same opportunities to exploit the system’s metals and minerals but far better organized, the Zenithians rebuilt many of the cities. The Consortium and other companies quickly conquered Algol and The Golden Age of the Zenithians began.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"ZgmyfsYgMQ2y540r","name":"02 - Algol Today","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>ALGOL TODAY</h1>\n<p>Today, the Algol system is controlled by the Zenithians through the Consortium, The Zenithian Hegemony, and a number of smaller factions. Since the only easily colonized planet is Algol, life in the system is mainly concentrated there. But Algol’s influence extends far beyond the system, as a large Algolan diaspora has settled throughout the Horizon - including at the Monolith and the Conglomerate, both on Kua.</p>\n<h2>THE CONSORTIUM AND THE COLONIAL AGENCY</h2>\n<p>The Consortium is the largest faction on Algol. With birr, grav cranes, and Vulcan might, the corporations of the Consortium seized control of the ruined cities and began extracting the planet’s natural resources. Infrastructure was repaired and expanded, but vulgar displays of wealth next to growing shantytowns have become the face of the Consortium on Algol.</p>\n<p>Of all the members of the Consortium, the Colonial Agency exerts the greatest influence on Algol. This corporation operates a number of mining companies and orchestrated the emptying of the planet’s inland Mengol Sea. But other large companies such as Hyperion and Alkarra also have major interests and industries on Algol.</p>\n<p>To help maintain order, the Consortium relies upon the Legion, which has permanently parked the cruiser GevennonParras in orbit around the planet to serve as a space station and surveillance platform.</p>\n<h2>THE ZENITHIAN HEGEMONY</h2>\n<p>The Zenithian Hegemony has also invested heavily in several of the planet’s cities through the Algolan community that thrives in the shadow of the Monolith on Kua. Through their Algolan vassals, the Hegemony exercises control over large segments of the workforce around Algol’s major cities, despite the fact that the Free League has tried to persuade the workers to join them instead. The Hegemonists themselves seldom visit the planet, relying on Algolans or low-blooded Zenithians to pursue their interests.</p>\n<h2>THE REBELS OF HAVEN</h2>\n<p>However, not all Algolans kneel before their Zenithian overlords. Systematic abuse against the people and the planet have fueled resistance and revolt. Tribes, clans, and even entire cities have risen up against their colonial masters, forging alliances with laborers to attack the ruling factions’ economic interests. These rebels keep to the rugged highlands, the frozen deserts near the planet’s poles, and the forests of the taiga to the south.</p>\n<p>The rebel groups' biggest victory was the conquest of New Nabul, where they forced the Consortium to withdraw after three Cycles of fighting knocked out parts of the newly-built city's energy supply. In the aftermath of this, the Consortium decided that keeping the city was no longer profitable. The rebels now rule the city, under General Yihanna and her elephant-riding warriors. They have renamed it Haven.</p>\n<h2>SKAVARA</h2>\n<p>Semi-intelligent creatures called Skavara live in packs around human settlements. They are relative newcomers to the Algol system. Traders brought the snarling, badgerlike Skavara from the Amedo system to Algol, where they multiplied in the shadow of humanity. In recent years, many rebel groups have adopted Skavara and trained them to work as infiltrators. They are adept at moving about unseen, and can be found in the industrial areas around the big cities and in isolated mining colonies.</p>\n<h3>✺ NEKATRA INCURSIONS</h3>\n<p>The Consortium and the Legion were quick to address the problem of the rebels using semi-intelligent Skavara as infiltrators. Few Zenithians can distinguish Skavara from ordinary animals, and to counter the rebel infiltration effort several of the Legion’s infamous Nekatra brigades have been posted at the orbiting cruiser Gevennon-Parras and in outposts all over the planet. Now both rebels and Skavara fear the advance of the Nekatra – as they are only constrained via telemetric guide collars, which are often defective.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}

While they pale in comparison to Odacon's damned surface, areas around the largest crater fields are said to be haunted by those who lost their lives there. Evil dybbuk and kafras are said to possess prospectors and rebels who pass through the area. The soil and air are sometimes toxic in these places, even though the bombardment was not thermonuclear.</p>\n<h2>STORMS OF THE LADY</h2>\n<p>Environmental damage caused by the Portal Wars and exacerbated by the mining operations of the Consortium and other corporations has turned large parts of the planet into vast wastelands and deserts. When the winds blow strongly in these areas, it’s said the Lady of Tears is gathering her dead. Giant dust storms develop, sometimes producing strong electrostatic changes that make flight dangerous for low-flying spaceships and intra-atmospheric craft. The worst dust storms occur in the desert areas formed after the emptying of the Mengol Sea.

{"_id":"h83AgnqcQA0U3yjh","name":"11 - Locations in the City","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>LOCATIONS IN THE CITY</h1>\n<p>Akhandar is the largest of the cities in the AYM metropolis and also the seat of the Church of the Icons on the planet. It’s also the center of operations for Algol’s infamous slavers – something that is not boasted about.</p>\n<p>The city is divided into a number of different urban districts, each of which is governed or controlled by an individual large company or a faction. This does not mean that the districts can be compared to the industrial islands or business districts that exist in the Conglomerate. Rather, that there is a company that is responsible for maintenance, safety, and in many cases some kind of healthcare facility.</p>\n<p>The shantytowns around the city and The Undercity do not enjoy the same sense of order, and the police only enter these areas when they are hunting rebels. Worker cooperatives or the opor cartels – or in the worst cases, the Slavers – operate as their own police force in these areas.</p>\n<h2>THE UNDERCITY</h2>\n<p>The Bulletin’s propaganda machine describes Akhandar as “the newly-built miracle”. But below it lies The Undercity. In places where it was not economical to demolish the underlying ruins, large beams and platforms were set up over the old city and the new one was built on top. This construction technique was most frequently used in Akandar’s old coastal districts and over the old port.</p>\n<p>In time, The Undercity became home to the outcasts who could not even secure a place in the large shanty town that lies like a carpet around the city. In addition, Akhandar’s shadier elements use The Undercity as a base and a refuge. Rebel groups, the opor cartels and the Slavers rule in The Undercity and have control over all avenues into and out of the depths. Corporate police and Rebel Hunters rarely dare to venture into the depths.</p>\n<h3>✺ THE DRAGON</h3>\n<p>Recently, workers, rebels and even members of the wellorganized Slavers have disappeared in The Undercity – in some cases without a trace, but other times leaving evidence of a bloody slaughter. No one knows who or what is doing this – or even whether the disappearances are connected. There is talk of a monster that emerges from the deep ruins of the Undercity. Others believe a Draconite has arrived in Akhandar to put an end to the slave trade. Now important people from the districts above the port platforms have also disappeared, and company police forces are finally showing interest in what is happening.</p>\n<h2>THE SOUK OF LOST SOULS</h2>\n<p>In the shadows of The Undercity lies Akhandar's famous and hidden slave market, known by the common people as The Souk of Lost Souls. Here, dupatta-wrapped Slavers gather – their identities hidden behind thermal visors and voice distorters – to broker deals and sell slaves to The Syndicate, The Serpent, or other shady organizations. It is said that companies are also represented – and that trade in birth certificates and blood signs is common. Here, anonymity is important and few people – beyond those being traded as goods – will reveal their faces while in the market. Many servants in Akhandar's well-to-do districts or in factory complexes are in fact slaves with fabricated identities in order to appear as ordinary citizens. In this way, slaves can be exported freely across the Horizon.</p>\n<h2>THE ELEPHANT MARKET</h2>\n<p>On the outskirts of the trading district is Algol's large bazaar and market. The most famous section – the Elephant Market – is a special place that is visited by traders, families, and tourists. Colorfully patterned tents shade the animals that, as much as the prayer towers, have become synonymous with Algol. At the Elephant Market, visitors will find everything from small lively dwarf elephants to the majestic white madra elephants, but also working animals such as carrier elephants and the woolly steppe breeds. Also on sale are all the things used for care, decoration, painting, grooming, and riding.</p>\n<h3>✺ ELEPHANT DAY</h3>\n<p>Elephant Day is an annual celebration, during which the animals are decorated and painted in various vivid colors and their pastures are adorned with gold. The highlight is a parade in which the elephants are marched through the city, even into the wealthiest districts.</p>\n<h2>THE CRATER CATHEDRAL</h2>\n<p>Like a blue tooth, the newly built Crater Cathedral rises up from Akhandar's bazaar. During important festivals, the city and the cathedral are filled with dignitaries and worshippers.</p>\n<p>The azure dome of the cathedral covers the largest crater created during the bombardment of The Age of Flaming Tears. When the Zenithians arrived and reconstruction began, they decided a new cathedral would be erected as a gift to the people of Akhandar and as a memorial of the wars that followed the bombardment. The dome covers the entire crater and is surrounded by eight slightly sloping prayer towers. On clear days, the dome can be seen from orbit as a blue circle surrounded by the bazaar's crowds and the arid bed of the Mengol Sea.</p>\n<p>When it was built, a large park surrounded the dome. But over time, a bazaar has taken over and the entire area is now covered with tents and goods, completely filling the park.</p>\n<p>The Crater Cathedral is the power base for the patriarchs Hieronymos dol-Kua and Ammangatha Par-Zur of the Church of the Icons.</p>\n<h2>THE GARDI TOWER</h2>\n<p>The prayer tower in Akhandar is the city's tallest building and was created by the famous architect Yassa dol-Gardi. Yassa was inspired when she visited the perforated rocks in Qusuf, which were shaped by the erosion of wind and sand into a natural wind instrument. The Gardi prayer tower was built with resonating boxes and air ducts, designed to carry prayer eulogies and sermons throughout the district without artificial amplification. Even the wind itself can create echoing sad tones when it blows from the right direction. Many visitors find that the tower most resembles a cheese or cream cake with its meandering shapes and holes.</p>\n<h2>AKHANDAR’S GRAVCAR COURSE</h2>\n<p>On the outskirts of the city towards Mengol's mining community, where the shantytowns slope down to the old seabed, Akhandar's gravcar course is located in a newlybuilt concrete complex of gray pillars and rounded domes. The annual Akhandar Rally is held here in early summer, before the temperature has risen too much and the risk of dust storms becomes too great. The wealthy and privileged, along with various glider factories and shipyards, all sponsor well-known drivers. The competition is broadcast live (with some delay) via the Bulletin's sports channels to those across the Horizon who are interested. The final event in the annual rally is especially famous as everyone who wants to take part – and has enough birr to race – can do so in a race with no rules. Amidst the wreckage of many smoking gravcars, a winner is chosen and those who sponsored the victor can look forward to several new orders for ships and grav generators.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"taIM1uEXjiobv6do","name":"05 - System Phenomena","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>SYSTEM PHENOMENA</h1>\n<p>Algol is rightly called “The Demon Star”, as the entire system hides dangers for the unwary traveler or prospector around every corner, from the smallest rock to the largest asteroid. It is often a small, almost random danger that inflicts the most harm: everything from black birr, to scorpions in a miner’s exo-suit, to an unexpected solar eclipse, or the risk of wandering into a crater field.</p>\n<h2>TABRIK’S LION</h2>\n<p>A rare phenomenon called Tabrik's Lion affects the portals in the Algol system. Astronics and Astrogators believe that due to the high speed at which Algol and Persei spin around each other, the stars form ball-shaped protuberances that seem to be drawn towards the portal fields. The name comes from the last words of the captain of the cruiser Tabrik, which disappeared as it left Algol after the planetary bombardment during the Portal Wars: \"A lion, a lion – The Icons are with us\".</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"vfQ0uPDhxbMYk6g9","name":"03 - Conflicts","content":"<div class=\"coriolis-community-atlas-journal-entry\">\n<h1>CONFLICTS</h1>\n<p>The conflict that pits factions and companies against the rebels has taken over daily life on Algol. While the companies have consolidated their power in large urban areas, the wilderness and isolated mining posts are not as secure.</p>\n<h2>YIHANNA AND THE MONSTER</h2>\n<p>The largest conflict on the planet is located in the southern hemisphere, in the metropolis formed by the cities of Akhandar-O-Sharif, Yasul, and Merkate, often called the AYM metropolis. The rebel headquarters, Haven, is located just south of the metropolis, near the now dried-up Mengol Sea. From Haven, small units of rebel warriors infiltrate AYM's shantytowns and the industrial complexes outside the city centers - to commit sabotage and free captured insurgents.</p>\n<p>Colonial governor Abbaras “The Monster” Quam (a member of the Consortium with Hegemonic blood) has several times proposed destroying Haven using the strategic nuclear weapons aboard the Legion’s orbiting cruiser Gevennon-Parras. But the prevailing northerly winds prevent any such attacks, as they would spread fallout over the entire Mengol Sea mining district and AYM itself. Ordinary conventional warfare has been judged to be too expensive, so a protracted shah game is now taking place. Legion strike forces supported by loyal citizens and nekatra fight against rebels – who defend themselves with the help of homemade drones, Skavara, and elephants.</p>\n<h2>SLAVERS</h2>\n<p>The only group that benefits from the unrest on the planet and in the system as a whole are the Algolan Slavers. The Church of the Icons’ ban on slavery doesn’t seem to deter them.</p>\n<p>Slavers are active mainly in the shantytowns where beautiful and strong young men and women are kidnapped and sold to the dars on Dabaran, to the factory islands in the Conglomerate, or to work the Newlands on Sadaal. New slaves are loaded into small vessels and taken to large bulk haulers hidden on the edges of the Cloud Belt in Rhaas’ northern heliopause. Once filled, these ships transport their living cargo out of the system.</p>\n<h2>THE DRACONITES</h2>\n<p>Some pundits and prophets believe the Draconites have now arrived in Algol to end injustice in the system. Just as the Draconites stood up to the Zenith's commanders when that ship arrived in the Horizon, it’s said they have come to Algol to support the rebels against the Consortium and Hegemonic oppressors. To date, nobody – on either side of the conflict – has been able to confirm their presence.</p></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9lJzeDMf24iRID0x":3},"flags":{}}
